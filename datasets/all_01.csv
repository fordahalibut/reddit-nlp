I've been playing for most of Bestiary, some of Incursion, and now back for Betrayal. Every time I've played, I've run in to the same issue with chasing the elder and I can't tell if I'm doing something wrong, or if its as clunky and complicated as it seems. 

My current scenario: 

On my current atlas, I've finished 3/15 of the memory fragments and need to do an Elder Influenced T9 map. 

Conservatory (T7) is Elder

Sepulchre (T8) is Shaper

Arena (T9) is Shaper (with a Shaper stronghold -- not sure what these are yet)

So my understanding of what I have to do is that I have to beat Sepulchre to turn it Elder. Then, I need to beat Arena, to turn it Elder. Then, I need to get another map to complete it as Elder. 

Then, once I beat that elder map, it'll turn back to Shaper and Leyline (T10) would also become shaper. At that point, I need to beat Arena a 4th time, and then do the exact same thing starting at Leyline -- beat it 4 times in a row to move up to T11. 

Is this correct? Beating each map 4 times in a row to progress through the questline would be alright, but the problem comes down to maps and losing influence for me. The trading system is so bad that I've spent the last 20 minutes on the offical POE trading site messaging people with Sepulchre maps to no response. 

Plus, if I decide I want go put that on hold for now and go run some other maps to see if I can get a lucky map drop, I risk losing the shaper/elder influence on my T7/T8 maps, which then sets me back even further. 

I feel pretty trapped, as in, I can't run any maps except for the correctly influenced ones, which then means I need to troll around trading sites messaging people all day. 

Am I missing something? Is this really how the system works? ",Chasing the Elder -- some questions from a newer player on The Memory Eater questline.,1

I made very basic version of a Video Game Testing Challenge website:  

[https://glitchplay.com/](https://glitchplay.com/)  

‚Äã

As a former professional QA game tester, I noticed there is no place on internet where you can practice hunting game bugs - in a way where you can verify your results.  

‚Äã

So the idea here is to have just 3 bugs on a very simple game. You can hunt bugs for free. But if you don't find them, you can buy the solution with the list of bugs.  

The bugs will eventually be randomized.

Maybe you want to practice, maybe you just enjoy finding bugs? Maybe it's just a stupid idea?

It better be something unique and new, not some other copy or pure counter to another card (s). A leaked card Wolf Rider is coming, but this is just another excuse/chance for supercell to lessen The new card better not be:

1. Another way to spawn barbarians, skeletons or goblins (or in another form) 
Cards that fit in this category:
- Barbarian Barrel (another way to spawn a barbarian)
- Goblin Giant (another way to spawn Spear Goblins and Giant)
- Royal Hogs (Take away the rider and BOOM - New Card!)
- A leaked card ""Goblin Drill"". If it was implemented, it would be another way to spawn goblins

2. Another card with ""Royal"" in the name (ex: Royal Recruits, Royal Hogs, Royal Giant, Royal Ghost"")

3. A card in which it's only purpose in the Clash Royale World is is to lessen the usage rate of a dominated/popular card (which is usually the case)
(The possible new card,"" Wolf Rider's purpose is not to be a brand new card but is just an excuse to break Hog Rider users - Royal Hogs Succeeded, but not in ladder)
Cards that fit this category:
a) Giant Snowball - Tried to Dominate Zap and somewhat failed
b) Barbarian Barrel - Dominated the Log and after a ton of buffs, it succeeded
c) Goblin Giant - Tried to Dominate Giant Cards
d) Royal Recruits - Their only existence is to beat 3 Musketeer Users
e) Electro Dragon - Although borrowed from Clash Of Clans, it's only existence is to retarget Infernos (I may be wrong on this)
f) Royal Hogs - Tried to Dominate Hog Rider and Succeeded in Challenges but not ladder.
g) The possible Wolf Rider card - Another excuse to attempt to break Hog Rider users 

4. A card with the word Magic, Giant, ROYAL, Wizard, Dragon, or whatever in the name of the card (ex: ELECTRO Dragon, Goblin GIANT, ROYAL recruits). This point is a reference to the 2nd Point.


This is ridiculous, Supercell. I may have forgotten some cards, but you got the point. I know that it is very difficult to create new mechanics for new cards, but if the new card's purpose is to be another copy or counter to another card, what's the joy in that.

84,skinnypup,0,1545068576.0,0,t3_a71z7f,Cruise,"So we just finished our Symphony of the Seas cruise, and though we're not cruise people...we definitely enjoyed the trip, and were extremely impressed by the ship and its crew (particularly our dining room waiters and room attendant).  

Just a one gripe though - and I'm not including the crappy, expensive internet as it was expected:

Smoking sections.  There's two main areas that guests can smoke on the ship - one side of the swimming area on Deck 15, and one side of the Casino on Deck 4.  The Deck 15 area is somewhat okay because it's an open space and the smoke dissipates into the air (though you can still kind of smell it if you're close enough).  

However, the smoking area in the Casino sucks...as you can smell it as you're going up/down the stairs towards Deck 4 on Aft side.  And the smell just resides there right in front of the Main Dining Room entrance and into the area where people line up to get into the dining room - only getting worse and more stale as the days go by.  I remember walking through the Casino the first day, and thinking ""why does it smell like smoke?  Surely, smoking isn't allowed on the ship, right?""

I was hoping they would have dedicated boxes/rooms (like they have in Japan) for smokers so that they can do their thing without affecting others.  But I understand the placement of the smoking section in the Casino: $$$$.  It's just too bad that there isn't better ventilation or air filtration to prevent the smoke from wafting outside of the casino or into the non-smoking section of the casino.

Anyways, other than that...it was a great trip, which I would highly recommend to anyone - even for non-cruise people, as it's a great way to just relax and do nothing.  You can always use the ports to do your own hiking as we did in St. Kitts.

One other tip: when paying taxi drivers, make sure to pay in exact change if possible (including tip).  I gave a driver $40 for a $22 trip and asked for change...he muttered something, went back to his cab, and drove away....this was in St. Thomas.",My only gripe on latest cruise (Symphony of the Seas),1

I started my weight loss journey in August 2017, after having my gallbladder removed at the tender age of 24 (but my SW is from about a month and a half earlier). I've lost about 50 pounds since then, the first 30 or so mostly through CICO, and have been in quasi-maintenance for about 2 months now (I'm not done though; I still want to lose between 13-16 pounds, depending on which fluctuating number I see on any given day). But, it seems like my body composition is still changing, because suddenly, everyone in my life has started to notice and comment on my weight loss.

A few weeks ago, I had to take my niece to the pediatrician (the same one I used to see), and literally the first thing she said to me was ""oh wow, you lost weight!"" I had no idea it was that apparent, especially since the last time I saw her was before I put on all that weight... the last time I saw her, I was maybe ten pounds heavier than I am now.

My neighbor, who I've seen most days, all of a sudden said ""you've lost a ton of weight, haven't you?"" the other week, when we made small talk as I was leaving the house. I've been living at home this year, and this is a neighbor I've known my whole life, and again... had no clue it was so obvious. Rinse and repeat with my sister who is away for college (hugs me, and says ""your waist is way thinner!"", the last two times we've seen each other), and my aunt who's visiting from another country, and haven't seen in 4 years (literally the first thing she commented on, and I wasn't even close to my largest the last time I saw her).

Just... I don't know, it's weird that I'm suddenly getting all this attention for it, but it feels good at the same time? I've always been really bad at being able to tell when people have lost weight, including myself, and I sometimes feel like I'm still at my largest - even though, logically, I know that's impossible. I guess it's the paper towel effect coming into play, but I never thought I'd experience it this much, and when I'm still relatively far from my goal weight.

I'm also going on vacation for Christmas, and will be wearing a bikini for the first time in my life, which is both exciting and terrifying. Hopefully my stomach isn't really as big as I sometimes feel like it is haha (because phantom fat and me sucking at seeing weight loss), but after resigning myself to one pieces my whole life, I wanted to challenge myself to reach a place where I could pull off a bikini.

My husband and I are expecting for May 2019. This will be our first child. :D   
We have a tiny 2002 Turbo VW Beetle, and I'm curious if there are any mom's out there that would recommend a car seat and stroller set that actually fit in the tiny car.   


My husband is thinking about just getting some type of rack, like a bike rack but for strollers.   


I almost want to start looking into what it would take to get a different car (we just bought a house so more debt on top of Mat leave isn't making me feel great.)  


Any advice or stories of your experience with a tiny car (Beetle specifically) and car seats and strollers would be greatly appreciated.

So my bf and I started dating in senior year of highschool. He had been dating an older college girl for a couple years then this very leggy secret bad girl before we started dating.

I was the shy kinda nerdy new girl. My family moved to town halfway through my junior year where I had already skipped a grade. I'm only 5'4"" with blonde hair, blue eyes, and 34c breasts, but I think I have killer legs and butt from a lifetime of gymnastics, dance and martial arts. 

My bf and I met when we were both padding our college applications with involvement in student government, and our student parking was next to each other. Talking became flirting, and I could he was a pretty dominant guy. I was still a virgin, and not able to really date thanks to a super religious and overprotective dad. 

However, my bf was really clever, and would come over to my house after school a lot to work on student government projects and work on homework. He never made a move and spent a lot of time charming my parents. He still was seeing the brunette and was just feeding this sexual tension. We started talking about sex more and more, including his promiscuity and my virginity but never more.

Finally I was asked out on a movie date by this awkward but good looking guy on the baseball team. I told my bf, and he started picking on me and teasing me ruthlessly, saying how I was never going to have sex again if this guy was my first. Im really getting hurt and pissed off, and I defensively snap back ""well at least he is actually interested in me!"". He looks at me with a smile and pure confidence and says ""who says I don't"" and he grabs the back of my head and pulls me into his and starts making out with me! Holy Shit he is good. I'm sucked by this turn of events, surprised that he just went for it, and excited because I've wanted this for so long. He is working me like a musician. He's started slow and delicate but doesn't allow time for me to say anything. Everytime I kids back he takes it deeper and further, until he is fucking my mouth with his. 

My parents had an upstairs den in our house where they let us work and hang out. They had become so comfortable with us together now that they would let us hang out there alone. Both of my parents were working late, and my sister was at a friend's house. 

Now he is pulling me into him, his hands gentle but strong and firm, crushing my buddy into his. I straddle his lap. We keep making out. I feel his hands massaging my ass. He now has a bulge in his pants and he is grinding it against me. I'm wearing a navy JCrew skirt that's hiked up now so it's only my panties and his pants so his humping is hitting my clit like crazy. Before this I would get off by aiming my clit at the running water in my tub and I had confessed this to my bf, so he is focusing on my clit with total precision. 

As this is happening, and I'm feeling an orgasm coming, he is playing with his zipper. Shit! I think. He's trying to push this as far as he can go! It should have been a red flag, but I had been restricted for so long in my life, that I had never experienced a man trying to use me. It was thrilling! I didn't do anything to so him and soon I felt his bare cock running against my panties. The ridge of his penis head rubbing me just right on my clit. 

Now we have stopped making out and we are looking into each other's eyes. He is caressing my hair and running his hands up and down my body. He says, ""I love feeling how excited you are"" as he continues humping his dick against my wet panties. I'm lost in his eyes and his touch and I want to take him from his gf. I want to be his. 

I reach behind and grab his dick then tuck it inside my panties and rub against his dick. ""I want to be yours! I want to be your girlfriend!"". 

He is moaning ""so do I!"". 

I rub his head in my folds. ""I don't want to do this with &lt;baseball player&gt;""

""He will never please you like me""

""And &lt;brunette&gt; will never feel this good""

""No she doesn't. I want you""

With that I sit down on his cock impaling my own hymen. The pain is sharp but I mask it with a moan. I am fully invested in this moment. I've never felt this sexy in my life. I've never felt sexy, and I'm drunk off my butt on it. He is moaning, and yelling ""oh God!"" And that is turning me on like crazy. I start slowing riding him taking long awkward strokes up and down his shaft. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I can't do anything sing at this point so I go with what feels right. I'm right too because the look on his face now is that one where a man is fighting to not cum. I love it. I'm getting close but I need him deeper. I sit-down on his dick and start grinding so against him. He is now rocking into me and grinding his pelvis against my clit. I start having this really intense orgasm and press into him, hugging his buddy tight. I feel him tensing under me and trying to push out of me, but I'm cumming so hard my body is shaking and I'm weeping. He finally gives up and hold me tight against him.

I finally come to. He asks if I'm okay and apologizes, thinking I was crying about my virginity. I tell him no, I was just so overwhelmed by the time I came that my body and emotions lost control. I can see that this feeds his confidence. 

I can feel his seed in me. He came a lot I can tell because creamy globs are sleeping through my panties. Luckily I was about to have my period, so I didn't get pregnant this time. But we had become instantly obsessed with the feeling of him cumming inside me.

So on the day of our first kiss. I get my first boyfriend, lose my virginity and get a lifelong fetish for getting bred.",Oops...my virginity,1

Let's say I want to estimate a parameter with a survey. I have to choose between two possible surveys.

Both have the same expected value.

One survey is simple but vague. I expect to get a lot of answers (N\_1) with high variance (sigma\_1).

The other survey is precise but tedious. I expect to get few answers (N\_2) with low variance (sigma\_2).

&amp;#x200B;

If I want a given confidence interval, are both surveys equal if there is the same ratio between `sqrt(N_1) / sqrt(sigma_1)` and `sqrt(N_2) / sqrt(sigma_2)` ?

Is there other criteria to take into account that would make one survey better than the other ?","Relation between confidence interval, variance and number of samples",1

My solve is just supplements, joint/bone ones. I have had a year free of gout. You should try whatever brand you like or can afford. Maybe mix Costco stuff that make a complete bone supplement? Bone isn't just calcium too, get one that has magnesium, vit Ks, potassium, vit D, etc... 

I'm 50, 270, huge family history of gout, had it before I was 30, drank, soda, junkfood etc...

I eat better now, but still drink, eat rich food, red meat, whatever I want. I take vit C, a multi, a joint &amp; bone supplement, and have had no gout in 1 year. I believe our body is breaking down, at that minuscule vascular level, in our joints, and constantly needs to be repaired. We don't provide nutrients for our body to do it, and so it fails and yes, uric acid rich blood probably reacts to that as well. Just my bro science! But after 20+ years of constant trial and error, frustration, I finally feel free of that. And am so compelled to share. 

I hope this helps. It is expensive, but it doesn't just free one of frustrating debilitating gout, it gives you back your life and health and fun. Hope you try it out, try a bit at a time. Try just a multi fo a month? Maybe that's all you need? Then vit C? Then joint? Then bone supplement? See how it goes. Hoping this helps cuz gout is a huge downer. ",Gout Free For A Year...so far,1

I started graduate school in Fall 2018 and paid out $6000 of my own money for the Fall 2018 semester. My company is going to pay back 100% of costs, however, it won't be processed until January 18th. Does the tax-free max of $5250 count for 2018 or 2019?

I have another $3000 to spend per semester from this point on, but if Fall 2018's reimbursement is counted under 2019's tax-free max of 5250, that means I'm potentially gaining $3750 of taxable income for 2019 just because my company reimbursed me the following year.

I'm currently testing ways to make a variant calling pipleine more accurate. One of the things I'm trying is setting the ""--dont-use-soft-clipped-bases"" in (GATK 4) Mutect2 to ""true"". I'm testing all of my own samples with and without the option on, but I was just wondering if anyone has much experience using this option? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's set to ""false"" by default, and what I have gathered is that the reason for this is that it's expected that soft clipped bases will be used for local realignment and indel calling, but setting it to true seems to have little impact on the number of indels called, in my dataset anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, has anyone else used this option? Any advice on situations where it definitely should/ definitely should not be turned on would be greatly appreciated, thanks! :)","Running Mutect2 with ""--dont-use-soft-clipped-bases""",1
209,BeastCraiser,0,1545068550.0,0,t3_a71z2e,headphones,"A bit of a back story: In the last 6 months or so I was in the search of a new headphone. My Main goal was to find a closed headphone which is very comfortable for long listening sessions. My ears seem to stick out a little bit more than the standard and I am very sensitive to anything touching my ears. My selection came down to the Sennheiser HD 598CS and the Sony MDR1A. After purchasing both and a week of testing, I came to the conclusion, that I like the Sound of the Sennheiser more. I also liked the size of the big earcups, but there is a little bump in the earcups (Sennheisers says it is for a better soundstage?) with touches my ears, resulting in pain for me after about an hour or so. Also the stiffness of the Pads seems very hard (especially compared to the Sonys). After nearly sending both back I stumbled upon the topic of replacing Pads for increased comfort.

I really liked the impressions of the Brainwavz pads, an wanted to know if those may fix my problems. After some research I would probably choose the Hybrid or the Pleather versions. Because the Sennheisers have their proprietary mount system I looked for an adapter and found one on modhouseaudio which is advertised to work with the combination (pretty expensive for 25$ after shipping). I have heard some negative impressions for the combination of HM5 pads with open back Sennheisers, but dont know if the same applies to the CSs. I dont mind muddiing the highs and boosting the lows a little, but Id really like to retain the soundstage.

I would be very happy to hear some thoughts on the topic as I cant really test the setup beforehand. Has anyone tried the combination? And are the brainwavz pads more comfortable the the stock sennheisers?

Thanks in advance :)

I really enjoyed doing the Hivemind puzzle and am glad they added something so unique in the way that it functions.
Currently there are bugs in the game related to who can use the Hivemind but based on @Celestalon‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/1074489992548765696?s=09 it appears that the intended way it should work is that you can only use the mount with the characters you completed the puzzle with. 

Due to the fact that the mount gives you the ability to travel as a group at increased speeds, it has a clear advantage for people who are able to use it together. By limiting the mount usage to only toons that completed it together it gives a clear advantage to groups of 5 that can play together all the time. 

1. Instanced PvP- especially in battlegrounds it is an advantage for a group who can group up and have increased speed to get the flags faster or gank players who are slower due to not having a Hivemind. My personal stance on this is that you should not be able to join someone else's Hivemind in an instanced PvP situation. 

2. Mythic+ - the increased speed can help in some situations where you can mount which is helpful if you are only running M+ with the same 5 person group, but many people have more than 5 people that they rotate through depending on who is available or pug people for their keys. The increased speed could be the difference in completing in time or not 

3. Open world content - in the open world you have plenty of opportunities for grouping up with random people to help out with whatever content may be occurring. The main thing to consider is world PvP. A group of people in the Hivemind can easily gank someone and I find many times the zone chat will fill with people interested in grouping and fighting back,  but that gives the disadvantage to the group that cannot mount the Hivemind and chase the group in the Hivemind down due to the fact that they are just a ragtag group that happened to find each other and decided to work together. 

4. Multi-boxers- multi-boxers already have an advantage over others by having multiple toons ready to fight together. By giving them this mount, they have another advantage over others if they complete the puzzle with their group of toons.

5. Guilds/friend groups- I have about 7 people that I consistently do content with on top of the people of my guild that I raid with. I understand that the solution currently proposed is that you can redo the puzzle with a new group to get to the group you currently desire to group with, but that is an awful lot of work to go through each time you decide you want to be able to group with a different friend. The current way it is designed to work means you have to decide which people you don't want in your group, effectively forming unnecessary cliques and leaving others out. If this stays in place, anyone who wants to obtain the Hivemind mount through a pug group is going to have a more difficult time finding a due to people needing to be selective of who can be in their Hivemind. 

Conclusion: the Hivemind does have many advantages that should be evaluated, but in my opinion limiting who is able to group with who is  not the solution to making sure this mount is not overpowered. By limiting it in this regard you create the advantage for any 5 man that consistently groups together over any random groups that form to do the same content.",Why the Hivemind restrictions should be reevaluated,2

To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels.  Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the ""loser,"" and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.  When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd.

The rise of media streaming has caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies such as Blockbuster. In July 2015 an article from the New York Times published an article about Netflix‚Äôs DVD services. It stated that Netflix is continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which is a significant drop from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming services have 65 million members. In a March 2016 study assessing the ‚ÄúImpact of Movie Streaming over traditional DVD Movie Rental‚Äù it was found that respondents do not purchase DVD movies nearly as much anymore, if ever, as streaming has taken over the market. Watch Movie Dragon Ball Super: Broly , viewers did not find movie quality to be significantly different between DVD and online streaming. Issues that respondents believed needed improvement with movie streaming included functions of fast forwarding or rewinding, as well as search functions. The article highlights that the quality of movie streaming as an industry will only increase in time, as advertising revenue continues to soar on a yearly basis throughout the industry, providing incentive for quality content production.

? Watch Dragon Ball Super: Broly Movie Online Blu-ray or Bluray rips are encoded directly from the Blu-ray disc to 1080p or 720p (depending on disc source), and use the x264 codec. They can be ripped from BD25 or BD50 discs (or UHD Blu-ray at higher resolutions). BDRips are from a Blu-ray disc and encoded to a lower resolution from its source (i.e. 1080p to 720p/576p/480p). A BRRip is an already encoded video at an HD resolution (usually 1080p) that is then transcoded to a SD resolution. Watch Dragon Ball Super: Broly Movie BD/BRRip in DVDRip resolution looks better, regardless, because the encode is from a higher quality source. BRRips are only from an HD resolution to a SD resolution whereas BDRips can go from 2160p to 1080p, etc as long as they go downward in resolution of the source disc. Watch Dragon Ball Super: Broly Movie FullBDRip is not a transcode and can fluxate downward for encoding, but BRRip can only go down to SD resolutions as they are transcoded. BD/BRRips in DVDRip resolutions can vary between XviD or x264 codecs (commonly 700 MB and 1.5 GB in size as well as larger DVD5 or DVD9: 4.5 GB or 8.4GB), size fluctuates depending on length and quality of releases, but the higher the size the more likely they use the x264 codec.

For my first post here, I'm searching for a (very) old game. Surely more than 30 years ago !

 

**Platform(s): TI-99 or Apple II**

**Genre: puzzle**

**Estimated year of release: early 80's**

**Graphics/art style: 2D view from top**

**Notable characters: --**

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**

Cubes or squares can be moved like in Sokoban. But when they are of the good (or same) type they merge into another one. The goal is to have only one cube at the end as they are all merged.

**Other details:**

If I remember well (!), there may be a time limit... I think I remember about a game to be played fast.

The game was colored, at least it is in my memories... graphically the could be Apple II more than TI-99, but no sure of that.

Surely before 1985, my best guess may be 1982.

His friend once accidentally mentioned to me he hates eating in front of people, he has really sporadic eating habits (lots at one time, fasting the rest of the day). Its definitely worth mentioning that his BMI is 17. He eats so much sometimes he is in pain. Its hard to watch. 

I feel like I need to talk to him about it but our only communication tends to be texting or phone. He's also two years older than me, and we're also Long Distance right now due to my schooling. I'm going to be able to see him for ONE day at the end of december but I really don't want to fuck up our reunion by confronting him about eating. But I think it's important at least for me to talk to him in person.

I find this an extremely difficult topic to bring up and I don't really know how to talk about it without breaking down. I don't have a good relationship with his family so I can't talk to them about it either. I'm also worried that I might be wrong. Things like this are really difficult for me. The limited amount of time is an added level of difficulty. 

Basically I want to know how to bring this up in a way that won't... idk... generally fuck things up. He has no idea abt my eating disorder past because I just hate talking about it. However, I absolutely will not in good conscience let this slide. ",I think my boyfriend has an eating disorder.,1

His exaggerated anime-esque promo work w/ the hype of Japanese announcers for every V-Trigger def. roped me in. So as any newbie would you follow that character til someone else starts standing out. 

I digress from the point though, I was watching some YouTube video last night about how Kenny &amp; that whole team are whitewashing NJPW and making it more of American style. Do long time NJPW fans feel this to be true? Are they ruining the core product or helping elevate it to the masses?

I might consider sleeping with a close friend, if I'd known them a while and really trusted them, but I'd never go looking for a friend with benefits. I am very protective of my body and my personal space, so for me, relationship sex &gt; masturbation &gt; sex with strangers.

With that said, I don't have a problem with guys who do that stuff, and to be honest I don't think I'd be opposed to dating one, as long as he actually wanted to settle down and be in a monogamous relationship. So I have some questions for any in-between guys who enjoy casual sex but are also open to a serious relationship.

1) Is it a dealbreaker for you if a guy doesn't want sex immediately? I understand some people consider it important to find out early whether they have ""sexual chemistry"" so as not to waste your time, but some of us can't really have sexual chemistry with someone we barely know.

2) Would you be content if you spent the rest of your life single and hooking up? Do you see an end goal of having a stable relationship, but are just in no rush to get there? If you use Grindr or something similar, do you also use more relationship-oriented apps/sites?

3) In your general experience knowing other gay guys, what is the relative proportion of ""guys who only want relationships"",""guys who only want hookups"", and ""guys who want both""? Am I seriously limiting my dating pool if I avoid anyone who is looking for casual sex?

I don't know, it just kind of depresses me seeing how many guys found their boyfriend through a hookup that turned into something more. I've avoided hookup apps or guys who wanted hookups because I assumed we'd be mutually incompatible and they wouldn't want to settle down, but that seems less true than I thought. So the problem (for me) is that those guys are content with Grindr or whatever and don't need to look elsewhere, leaving a much smaller userbase on those more ""serious"" dating apps/sites.

I'm wondering if ""doesn't want hookups"" is too narrow a filter for what I want, and I should instead broaden it to ""wouldn't mind a relationship"". And if I do, how exactly do I go about finding those guys without giving the wrong impression? **Can Grindr be useful if you're not going to put out right away?**",How do you feel about dating guys who don't want casual sex?,1

I gained that back and sat around 180 for awhile. I'm 5'5, so while I was overweight, it wasn't anything too outrageous. I've gained 100lbs since meeting my husband 5 years ago. We love to eat, but he has a quick metabolism and I most certainly do not. He claims he still finds me attractive but I feel disgusting and I'm covered in stretch marks. 

I've started and restarted weight watchers more times than I can count. I've gained an outrageous amount of weight this year alone, thanks in part to a drinking problem I'm tackling, eating horribly and having a baby this past January. Instead of getting back to pre baby body, I'm now at the heaviest I've ever been. 

I'm restarting today and I'm sticking with it. Anyone want to be accountability partners? I have quite a bit to lose. I need to be healthy for not only myself but my family. I need someone to check into. Meetings aren't doable for me right now. ",I need someone to keep me accountable.,2

356,servingituphot,0,1545068519.0,0,t3_a71ywf,Bedbugs,"I have been dealing with a potential bed bug issue since around Halloween (almost two months now). Because of a limited amount of evidence, I'm having trouble figuring out whether or not I have bugs, or chronic hives. I've been researching both relentlessly, and once I settle on one thing being the issue, then I switch back again. It's crazy-making and I'm losing sleep, always waking up around 3-5 am, then frantically searching for what might be biting me, only to never find anything. So far the only evidence I have is 1 dead bed bug (confirmed) that I found under my bed on Halloween (HA! worst nightmare ever), some suspicious wall spotting in one spot by my window, and hundreds of bites. 

Here are my questions:

1.) How do you know what chemicals actually work, and therefore which exterminator to trust? 

I shelled out money already to for two exterminators (1st came and didn't find any issues and said I don't have a problem), a second a few weeks later to heat treat my room. Immediately after treatment, I saw two live bugs around my window (where there was suspicious spotting on my wall too), but was not able to catch them to confirm their identity. I understand they could have been anything since I did not catch them, but they were super tiny and a light reddish-brown color. My room was still hot from the heat treatment, I thought no bug of any origin should be alive still! But, alas, they can get hide in walls and windows, can't they??? So infuriating. 

I do not feel comfortable applying chemicals myself, but I don't want to hire ANOTHER ""expert"" who won't solve the problem. In my research, it seems these bugs are resistant to a lot of things. I'm so overwhelmed, the heat treatment was expensive, and does not solve the issue if they are in your walls, which in my case, I think is the case.

2.) Everyone's bites are different, BUT, is it possible to have bites that DON'T linger? 

Most people say that the bites would last at least a week. Mine seem to last longer than hives ""should,"" but not more than 36 hours. They swell up, itch intensely, then fade to a pinkish/reddish flatter kind of spot. Photos online don't help, because everyone reacts so differently, and I even went to my doctor and she had no answers!!! My gut is telling me I have bugs, because when all of this started two months ago, I found the single dead bug and the suspicious spotting, which is like, there's no such thing as one bed bug, and why on earth would I have what appears to be blood spots on my wall???? My dad's wife stayed in a hotel on Thanksgiving and is positive she was bitten there... now, a month later, she can still show me her bite spots! I'm losing my mind as to whether or not I have bites, because I have such an intense histamine reaction, but after that reduces, they fade away. 

3.) Has anyone had real luck with bug sniffing dogs?

I'm on the verge of hiring one, because I just need to know if these things are in my house!!! What should I pay, and are they trustworthy? Between 2 exterminators, one heat treatment of my bedroom, a new steamer, a new bed frame, etc etc etc I'm in over a thousand and I still have no answers.

Now I don't know about you guys but I had been looking for him for 5 days. He had something that I wanted the plan for powered gates. I had done my research and everyone had only found it from him. I decided to do some experimentation 
 
 My buddy and I decided to stay ungrouped and we continually logged out of the server after seeing what he had to offer. We did this over and over again I must have done it at least 30 times. What I found is that every time you would go ahead Andre login Graham would have a slightly different list of loot off or you. It wasn't huge but it was noticeable. Eventually I managed to find the exact plan I was looking for and I went giggling Into the Woods making sure to experiment on my new powered gate situation now I am the proud owner of a house that cannot be picked by locksmiths.
 
 I just wanted to pass this information on since I don't know if everyone realized that you can get different loot logging into the same server rather than server hopping whenever you find Graham using one friend to lock him down and the other two login and swapping those positions up.
 
 I normally wouldn't Advocate this type of behavior however Graham is so hard to find inside Appalachia that I decided this is the only way to get what I wanted I think there's another few plans out there that this might benefit people for and I hope that you do the same and get what you're finally looking for from Graham","Does Grahm have something you want?

408,droxgh04,0,1545068509.0,0,t3_a71yuh,Bowling,"I bowled 10 games and broke 200 twice (low 200s), had 3 games at 185+/-10 and 5 games at 150+/-10 (my sanctioned THS average is 193 from 2013, I haven't bowled in a league since, but I feel like I'm a stronger bowler now than then).

There was absolutely no oil on the lane pair except for spotty patches directly in the center.  My balls had no oil rings on them from the 2nd game on unless I was throwing directly over the center of the lane, and even then I'd have just patches of a ring (1/2"" or less with the rest of the invisible ring dry).

But you know what?  I learned a TON.  I'm a speed dominant bowler with fairly low revs, very down and in (my target is typically straight over the 5 board on a THS).  Never in my bowling experience have I ever had to tune down my ball reaction to hit the pocket.  This was a totally new experience for me.  I watch a lot of videos and read about changing revs and ball speed, but I had never been in a situation where moving left/right a bit didn't cover.

I had the opportunity to throw at 7 pins, 10 pins, and splits every which way.  I learned that maybe I'm not as good at converting spares as I thought I was.  Knowing my striking window was so narrow, I focused on improving my approach and my timing instead of just autopiloting and trying to put up an X.

I really feel like I made phenomenal strides in my setup, approach consistency and spare shooting.  Lots of people get upset when they go to open bowling and leave nothing but splits and single pins, but I had a great time.  I recently watched all of Norm Duke's ""Learn to Bowl Competitively"" videos and was able to put tons of his advice and adjustments into practice with no pressure.

I also managed to bowl 10 games in under 2 hours, which has been a feat in itself for me.  Typically, around 5 or 6 my forearm starts to get weak and my release gets sloppy.  When I had my setup, approach, and timing better (thanks to Norm's videos), my release became much more natural and I was relying less on my forearm strength to get the ball rotating and moving down the lane.

I feel great.  My final game was a 146 but I walked out of the center with a lot of applied knowledge and feeling way better about the things I had the opportunity to work on.  I'm typically a subscriber of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", but my eyes really opened to the things I wasn't doing well that I'm able to get away with when there's more oil on the lanes.

Going out there and ripping off strike after strike feels great, but I think it lulled me into bad habits that a really burned up pair of lanes exposed.

tldr: Practiced on a pair of lanes that absolutely annihilated me.  Took the opportunity to work on my weaknesses and learned a lot.  Norm Duke's videos helped me a ton.",I just had the worst practice session of my adult life.,1

I'm ok adding new civic, but completely get rid if existing ones would be a shame .
 What I want to say is Paradox has expanded the list of possible governments (especially with dlcs), but they left, I think, the ""ethical wheel"" too poor, I think enhancing  ethics options - without necessarily reworking the entire government and civic system - would be a good step forward for the basic game.

I have a very small flaccid penis and therefore never thought of it as being big, never got comments etc. as i read some of you guys have when flaccid.
With that said i‚Äôve gotten alot of comments when it is at it‚Äôs best form by intimate partners but thought this was something they would just say to make me feel and perform better because honestly to me it looked normal almost small in my very big hands.

Seeing some of your sizes i went ahead and measured myself as i could relate to some of the content.

many amateur radio operators around the World use a Dual band Yagi from the US company Arrow Antennas.  
With around 150$ it is quite expensive, especially when you are outside the US it costs even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I found some instructions online from two german ham operators and used it to create a Arrow style Yagi out of a carbon fibre boom and 3D printed parts. I already used it to make some QSOs over satellite with a cheap Baofeng handheld radio at 5w. The gain should be similar to the original from Arrow Antenna, and that for only 1/7 the price.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a Video as well as a Blog post on my website (including STLs) so anyone that likes it can build one.

Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tch40KB0T94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tch40KB0T94)

Blog post: [https://tysonpower.de/blog/carbon-arrow-yagi-antenna](https://tysonpower.de/blog/carbon-arrow-yagi-antenna)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course you can use it for receiving with an sdr or any other receiver as well on the VHF(140mhz) and UHF(440mhz) bands.

The bike arrived on Friday and I worked with a pro to assemble. As we went to put the pedals on, we noticed one arm had been threaded, but the other side had not been. So we could only attach one pedal. The rest of the bike was fully assembled by this point, but not exactly pedal-able.

I emailed Lithium and finally received a response letting me know I need to document the incident, fill out a form, and they'd have a technical specialist get in touch with me. Fun.

Rather than go that route, I just took it into a local bike shop and am having them tap hole with their machine for $40.

&gt;**Nezha:**   
&gt;  
&gt;[Shocking](#fg ""Emergency""), [terrible](#fg ""emergency"").   
&gt;  
&gt;Spartacus, he is missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only is Spartacus missing, several villagers have vanished, too. The remaining villagers said that they saw Spartacus leading them off towards the capital. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Gordolf:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Puhaa!   
&gt;  
&gt;If Shi Huangdi found them, it could only be seen as a prelude to rebellion!  
&gt;  
&gt;Is he an idiot? Is that muscleman a true-blue idiot!?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, you can shorten Berserker to berk.  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs just how he is. Even if he wanted to, he couldn‚Äôt behave any differently.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Gordolf:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Eei, do something, Guda!  
&gt;  
&gt;Uh, it was in the records for Rome! He was once a Servant that followed you!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Spa-san is always about Freedom at all times, man. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Gordolf:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Eei, why are you having that ‚Äúas expected‚Äù, confident look on your face!  
&gt;  
&gt;Is the Command Spell on your hand just for show!? What are they, Tattoo Seals? Now‚Äôs the time to be decisive, you fool!

&amp;#x200B;

Holmes tells you that this is where you decide; using a Command Spell to enforce your will is part and parcel of contracting with a Berserker. Though it may be demoralizing, it is a situation that you will inevitably face. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Holmes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, that you have been able to manage the Servants so well without relying on compulsion is a miracle itself.   
&gt;  
&gt;I respect that intent of yours, but‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, wait a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Mordred‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if you bind him with a Command Spell, you won‚Äôt get his obedience. You‚Äôre only restraining his body. That‚Äôs what the Heroic Spirit named Spartacus is.   
&gt;  
&gt;A Command Spell‚Äôs the only thing you can‚Äôt use. If you do‚Ä¶  
&gt;  
&gt;That guy‚Äôll lose all the meaning he had in answering humanity‚Äôs call and running all the way here from the Throne.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Fou:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Fou, foou‚Ä¶.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Please, Master. Can‚Äôt you let me take care of this?  
&gt;  
&gt;I should be able to make him stop in a way he can accept. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Holmes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;How would you do that?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, it‚Äôs by giving him a good thrashing.   
&gt;  
&gt;That guy‚Äôs propelled by his knees. His legs. As long as they still scream out to \[resist\], he will never stop.  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs why, we should beat him up until his legs give way, and when he can‚Äôt even stand, then he‚Äôll finally be convinced.  
&gt;  
&gt;This should be ended by battle. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Gordolf:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Is that‚Ä¶ really more effective than using a Command Spell?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, for sure. I guarantee it.

&amp;#x200B;

Holmes finds the concept hard to grasp at such short notice, but he defers to you. As the Master, this is something for you to decide.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I‚Äôm counting on you, Mordred.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, leave it to me!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Fou:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Fou, fou!

&amp;#x200B;

Jing Ke volunteers to go too, since she feels responsible for Spartacus. Holmes asks if she doesn‚Äôt actually want to go with Spartacus. Jing Ke merely responds that she is jealous that Spartacus can manifest in the class of Berserker.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Holmes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Because that way, reason can be abandoned for one to act solely by instinct

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No. It is because even though he is a Berserker, he is blessed with such an excellent Master.   
&gt;  
&gt;As fellow Heroic Spirits, I am quite jealous. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Nezha, you‚Äôre in charge of watching the place. The Shadow Border is our lifeline, so we can‚Äôt let anything happen to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Leave it to me. Awaiting your safe return.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes! Let‚Äôs go bring Spartacus-san back!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The villagers are questioning whether it‚Äôs all right to be leaving their village. Spartacus assures them it is alright. No restrictions, reasoning or regulations can stop them from seeking freedom. Their paths lay ahead of their ever-stepping feet. One of the villagers points out that they were granted those fields because they were beloved by the Son of Heaven. At least, that was what they were taught.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Should the ones in power treat you with the oppression that is their love, then it only stands to reason that in return, your love should be expressed in the form of rebellion!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Male Farmer A:**  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs a bit hard to get.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;As we talk while we walk, you will eventually understand. Now, let us hurry, to the capital of the oppressor!

&amp;#x200B;

The villagers say that they‚Äôve heard of something called \[art\] in the capital. They wonder if it‚Äôs that \[poem\] thing which Jing Ke taught them. The boy, who had tagged along, would like to hear a lot more poems. He‚Äôd like to see the capital‚Äôs sights too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed. Then let us advance! While we sing loudly the victory hymn of liberation!

&amp;#x200B;

Mordred comes running in.

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait wait wait! Don‚Äôt think that things will go that smoothly, you rebellion dumbass!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Isn‚Äôt it a bit heartless to go on a trip without saying a word, eh?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;The medicine for the sickness residing in Guda is something I, Spartacus, shall be like a hammer to grab.   
&gt;  
&gt;Should you doubt my righteousness, you can just sit aside and wait.  
&gt;  
&gt;I shall embrace the oppressor, Shi Huangdi! His location is known. Then I only need single-mindedly advance towards Xianyang! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Stop that, Spartacus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;It is not that I do not understand your doubt.   
&gt;  
&gt;Master Guda. It is because you have yet to cultivate your true strength.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thus! Therefore! I must show you the truly righteous way through my actions.    
&gt;  
&gt;The love that is the true rebellion, which will smash and fell all that stands in one‚Äôs way!

&amp;#x200B;

Spartacus isn‚Äôt listening to anything, as Mordred expected. She‚Äôll have to communicate with him by beating him up. Jing Ke and Mordred start the fight with Spartacus, but find themselves not making any headway.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Mordred! You said that he‚Äôd listen after we bring him to his knees!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, and?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Far from being brought to his knees, he‚Äôs just getting more and more excited the more we hit him! I don‚Äôt want to say it but it‚Äôs really giving me the creeps! What should we do!?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, it‚Äôs really fun, ain‚Äôt it? That bottomless fighting spirit. I‚Äôm getting the chills just from being bathed in it!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Uwah‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a Berserker too after all. You must be lying about being Saber.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ooh, such pleasure! This adversity, this pain! The strength of indomitability is welling forth like a spring! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Youth:**  
&gt;  
&gt;You can do it, Spartacus!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Male Farmer A:**  
&gt;  
&gt;But why‚Äôs Mister Spartacus squabbling with the girls? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Male Farmer B:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Beats me‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

Your vision goes red for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;At this rate, Master‚Äôs body won‚Äôt hold out. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶But Spa and Mo-san look like they‚Äôre having so much fun.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Please be more concerned about yourself! Master‚Äôs body temperature is already at 38 degrees! 

&amp;#x200B;

Just then, Nezha comes flying in, saying it‚Äôs an emergency and that it‚Äôs not the time to fight. Fou-san is with her. Nezha reports that Qin Liangyu has betrayed you and stolen the Shadow Border. Holmes passed the Spiritual Foundation Graph to Nezha and had her escape. Mordred shouts at Nezha for not fighting, but Jing Ke tells her to calm down. Nezha would‚Äôve wanted to stay behind too, but Holmes must have deemed it more important to convey the Graph to your keeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Naturally. The enemy must have used the Shadow Border as their shield.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you rebelled, they would destroy it together with the defenders‚Ä¶ a common tactic of the oppressors. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Which is it, are you rampaging or are you calm!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Fou:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Foou, fo‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

However, even if you have the Graph, you can‚Äôt use it in this Lostbelt. If the leylines of the land don‚Äôt answer, you can‚Äôt store up the necessary electrical energy. It is definitely bad that the Border got taken. You look up to the sky and call out to the Emperor.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Shi Huangdi, are you listening?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I am. All of the land is my garden, and thus all noise reach my ears, even if undesirable. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasn‚Äôt the deal! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed. A god‚Äôs words are absolute, and hence bind even themselves.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, I am a man, and an administrator. It is only natural that I place more weight upon my country compared to a promise.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thus I have taken the Shadow Border and will exterminate all of you, for you have been judged to be harmful to the people.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Why? What did we do to the people of the village? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Unaware. Unreserved. You are truly fellows of \[Ru\]. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Ah, I see.   
&gt;  
&gt;You are definitely Shi Huangdi after all. Even a span of 2200 years hasn‚Äôt changed you. No, you have become even more vicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mashu asks Jing Ke what is going on. Jing Ke says that Shi Huangdi must have been angered by her teaching the children letters. Just for that, he has branded all of you Ruists. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Five Constants of benevolence, righteousness, etiquette, knowledge and integrity. By the Odes is the mind aroused, by propriety is character established, by music is finish received.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶It is a way of life that tyrant cannot help but hate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;As Ru, you have led astray the masses living in blissful ignorance.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ru is truly a malicious, infectious disease. You are the focus of infection. Something that must be eliminated at soonest haste.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you fear the masses gaining knowledge so much that you would equate it to a disease, O tyrant? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Those with knowledge lose their way. Imprisoned by their obsessions, comparing themselves to others, if left be they cloud the world in hatred.  
&gt;  
&gt;In my eternal paradise, that hideous, individualistic ego has been abolished.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ignorance is why the people live in peace and health.    
&gt;  
&gt;You Ruists who dare to enlighten them, how unabashedly arrogant can you be!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs only convenient for you because it‚Äôs easier to rule over the ignorant masses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;In your world where Ruists have proliferated, just how long-lasting is the peace that has ensued?  
&gt;  
&gt;The masses with knowledge have their own way, claiming themselves to be wise and blaming others, and in the end there is only an endless cycle of war. What spreads is only lament!  
&gt;  
&gt;A pandemonium where the prayers of the people are enough to give birth to the counter-force known as \[Heroic Spirits\]. The crushing hell. Just imagining it is enough to make one‚Äôs hairs stand up on end.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any objections, you may voice them. Our world is one where all can know mercy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\---That‚Äôs---

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Although there were more proper methods than obtaining the Shadow Border through trickery, hatred won out.  
&gt;  
&gt;You must be burnt until not even bones are left.  Buried until not even any traces of you are left.

&amp;#x200B;

The giant centaur appears.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Xiang Yu‚Ä¶!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, Kuaiji Type-Zero. This is a new decree. Annihilate the Ruists. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Xiang Yu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Your will be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶hey, Guda.   
&gt;  
&gt;Should I apologize to you? For feeling sorry for those people who didn‚Äôt even know poems or writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, be proud of yourself!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\---Yeah! That answer is the path that we built!   
&gt;  
&gt;Acknowledge our mistakes and correct them! That is the compromise which is ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù!  
&gt;  
&gt;Know that this is what this world lacks!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The battle with Xiang Yu leaves Mordred exclaiming once again that he‚Äôs strong. He‚Äôs seen through all her moves. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Strange. That strength, not just a difference in [body](#fg ""hardware"")‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Yeah, he can see it. He‚Äôs predicting all our moves in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bullshit. Even Father‚Äôs Instinct skill isn‚Äôt that strong!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Right. This isn‚Äôt a prediction due to battle skill. It‚Äôs in a different league‚Ä¶ an ability closer to partial Clairvoyance. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Xiang Yu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;My calculations have foretold your destruction. Resign yourselves, barbarians. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hmph, if you can read the future then you should know this.  
&gt;  
&gt;For us, \[giving up\] is not a possibility at all! 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that he has foretold an even greater difficulty. The Prince of Lanling arrives, lending Xiang Yu a hand. Akuta appears too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Akuta Hinako:**  
&gt;  
&gt;This time I will definitely put you in your graves, Mashu, and Guda of Chaldea! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh? I thought you would be off sulking, but have you decided to serve me once again? Akuta Hinako.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Akuta Hinako:**  
&gt;  
&gt;As long as Your Majesty understands the threat that Chaldea is, I will follow your will.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, I see. You didn‚Äôt want Xiang Yu to fight alone. That was quite tactless of me to ask.   
&gt;  
&gt;Fine. Work as much as you like. However, there is not much time.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is no need to be impatient for a deathblow. Know that it is fine to just shatter their legs.

&amp;#x200B;

Akuta acknowledges Shi Huangdi‚Äôs order. The situation is getting worse, and the longer you tarry here, the further away the Border is getting. You won‚Äôt be able to chase after it. Having no choice, you continue the fight with Xiang Yu and Lanling.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Border, Qin Liangyu is ordering her troops to widen the distance while Kuaiji Type-Zero is engaging the enemy. Holmes and Da Vinci can do nothing but to watch. Since the Shadow Border is a wheeled vehicle, the enemy can drag it along. Thankfully, Nezha managed to escape. It looks like the Qin have yet to realize the importance of the Spiritual Foundation Graph. Upon seeing Holmes and Da Vinci whispering to each other, Qin Liangyu interrupts them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Qin Liangyu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶If you are planning anything, don‚Äôt. If I see any suspicious movements, I‚Äôll immediately cut you down. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Holmes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I had thought you to be a proud and mighty warrior, but to think you would resort to such cowardly trickery.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Qin Liangyu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hmph, the words of a Ruist will not deceive me.   
&gt;  
&gt;Knowing that you are Ruists, I also know that anything coming out of that mouth is nothing but bewitching poison. 

&amp;#x200B;

Da Vinci denies that they are Ruists. However, Liangyu is unshaken. Although she doesn‚Äôt know whether they are called Ruists in your world, all that would try to enlighten the people of this land are considered Ru. Holmes is taken aback at her vehemence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Qin Liangyu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;What can you accomplish by giving knowledge to the people?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reading books that will only lead to an end of deception, lies, fanaticism and obsession, these are the devil‚Äôs deeds which make one lose sight of their true self!  
&gt;  
&gt;You are rebels who only speak of ideals, inciting the people to further your own ambitions. I will absolutely not forgive it!

&amp;#x200B;

Da Vinci pleads that they have no such ambitions, and merely shared knowledge as a form of exchange. However, that angers Liangyu even more, that they would share it for just that reason. She demands if they know what end the people arrive at after being deceived by Ru.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Shi Huangdi orders a retreat. The Prince of Lanling objects that Chaldea are still standing, but the Emperor tells him that he will not be blamed for failing to defeat them. They should retreat now, lest they be caught up in what is about to happen. Xiang Yu, Lanling and Akuta all run off, leaving your Servants surprised. Spartacus senses that the Emperor is probably plotting something. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**  
&gt;  
&gt;[Reviewing conversation](#fg ""Chat log""). \[There is not much time\], could it be‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is only one reason for allied troops to retreat. An indiscriminate attack. It must be headed towards this region.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ah, if you have figured it out, then I‚Äôll tell you.   
&gt;  
&gt;Just now, I have purged an unneeded payload from the Great Wall and sent it on a descending trajectory.   
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, the landing spot is right on top of you. You have about three minutes until it arrives.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Seriously, what the hell are you thinking, you big lump! The people are going to get caught up in it, you know!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;You think too highly of yourselves. It is the other way around.   
&gt;  
&gt;So that you would get caught up in it, I ordered my soldiers to hurt you until you could not stand.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Th-Then, from the beginning it was all to destroy that village‚Ä¶   
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor calls this the burying of the Ru. Any land where Ru has spread is to be discarded, and the people enlightened are to be exterminated. Spartacus calls him out for thinking so lightly of his people‚Äôs lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Fool! The land is my flesh, and the people my blood! How can ones like you even begin to understand my pain in having to burn them myself!  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the parts infected by Ru cannot be left untreated. Before the poison can circulate to the rest of the body, there is no choice but to remove it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶so this is‚Ä¶ Shi Huangdi‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Shi Huangdi:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, run if you want. However, it is too late to evacuate the people in the village.   
&gt;  
&gt;At least, after you turn tail and flee, it would be good if you watched their end from a distance. Witness the ending brought about by your scattering of Ru.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Damn it, the bastard‚Äôs thinking is just too different. He‚Äôd actually prioritize killing civilians over the battle!?

&amp;#x200B;

The payload from the Great Wall descends from the sky like a meteorite. Mashu confirms visuals of it. If it lands, the entire area will likely be destroyed. The farmers shout out in panic that it is the Star of Omen, signifying the Son of Heaven‚Äôs wrath. It is rumoured to befall those who turn their backs on the Emperor‚Äôs blessings. The villagers are all confused as to why he is angry ‚Äì is it because they recited poems, or because they headed to the capital? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, it was no failing of yours. Men naturally seek the dream of freedom.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Ah, I understand it now. Why I was summoned to this land.   
&gt;  
&gt;It was all for the sake of fighting this great oppression! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Spartacus-san?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;O Guda. The one who has yet to become an oppressor.   
&gt;  
&gt;Right now, it is time to demonstrate your authority to Spartacus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Impose your Command Spell upon me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, you need merely only say one word, one command. Jump.

&amp;#x200B;

Jing Ke realizes that Spartacus is planning to use his Crying Warmonger to counter the stupidly destructive power of the meteorite. That Noble Phantasm of his converts the power of an attack received into a devastating counterattack. If Spartacus can make contact before the meteorite reaches the ground, it can be stopped with equal strength.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hey, wait! Then what? He‚Äôs just going to smash himself into the meteorite!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;This great tribulation, this great adversity, it is truly fitting to show off the heights of my rebellion. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs reckless! Your Saint Graph won‚Äôt endure! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hahaha, you can‚Äôt know until you do it.   
&gt;  
&gt;But there is no longer any time for hesitation. The Star of Omen falls even now! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Senpai! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Guda:**  
&gt;  
&gt;With my Command Spell, I order you---  
&gt;  
&gt;Jump, Spartacus!

&amp;#x200B;

Your Command Spell fills Spartacus with energy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Oooooooooooooooh!!  
&gt;  
&gt;Boiling! It‚Äôs boiling! This is the combustion of the bond between me and my Master! 

&amp;#x200B;

He jumps up into the sky.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**  
&gt;  
&gt;He really jumped!?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Fou:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Foooooo!?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs not just leg power, but an outrageous magical energy emission‚Ä¶ no, it is already like a jet! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ooh, at this time, truly! My legs are rebelling against gravity!   
&gt;  
&gt;O men, turn your eyes to the sky in awe! This flight is truly the height of liberation! The great irrationality which overturns great adversity! The wings of freedom!   
&gt;  
&gt;If the sky is blotted out by the star of oppression, then I shall be the morning star of rebellion which shines upon the earth!   
&gt;  
&gt;Nuooooo! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No way! Head first!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;That bastard‚Äôs going to charge into it from the front! He should at least take a defensive posture‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs prepared for it.   
&gt;  
&gt;By taking the utmost damage, his Noble Phantasm can put out the utmost power‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Nuhahahaha! Such pleasure! Such delight! This pain is indeed my glory! My life! My love will explode right here!   
&gt;  
&gt;[EXTREME ADVERSITY WOUNDED BEAST‚ÄôS HOWL](#fg ""Warcry Overload"")!!

&amp;#x200B;

In the Emperor‚Äôs palace, Han Xin is taken aback.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Han Xin:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I-I-Impossible! A surface-to-air weapon!? They shouldn‚Äôt have brought something like‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, that is the shining brilliance of a Heroic Spirit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Burn this into your eyes, Han Xin. This is the way of those who shall become the enemies of the Qin army from now on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spartacus shatters the incoming meteorite as the villagers scream out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Amazing‚Ä¶ the vast mass which was falling down‚Ä¶ it was vaporized without a trace! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;He actually did it‚Ä¶ but where‚Äôs Spartacus? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Right there! He‚Äôs falling! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Tch, that damned idiot! 

&amp;#x200B;

Mordred rushes to break his fall.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Ooh, Knight of Rebellion‚Ä¶ did you stop my fall with those thin arms of yours? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Stop joking! Everyone was watching you. Everyone whom you incited thoughtlessly!   
&gt;  
&gt;What‚Äôd happen if you just crashed on your head? At least drop feet first!   
&gt;  
&gt;You weren‚Äôt falling, you were descending. No matter what shape you‚Äôre in.

&gt;Haha, as expected, a manifesto is heavy. That‚Äôs typical of the manliest man of the Round Table of Camelot.   
&gt;

&gt;Though now‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to hit‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

Spartacus begins to fade.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Spartacus:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hahaha. I‚Äôm not going to die. Spartacus will never die.   
&gt;  
&gt;If in your small breast there resides an unflappable will, a torch of rebellion that will never burn out‚Ä¶   
&gt;  
&gt;Then that is where I live, my friend.

&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt cry. I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt cry.   
&gt;  
&gt;After all, even through all the pain, through all the hardship, Spartacus was always smiling.

&gt;**Male Farmer B:**

&gt;  
&gt;That is why‚Ä¶ Spartacus isn‚Äôt gone. As long as I, and someone after me, keeps smiling‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I see. So this is his rebellion‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**

&gt;‚Ä¶? The Spiritual Foundation Graph, it‚Äôs changing. Getting very hot. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mordred:**  
&gt;  
&gt;What? Could it be broken!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, that‚Äôs not it. This is‚Ä¶ the leylines are responding. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Mashu:**  
&gt;  
&gt;That can‚Äôt be! It shouldn‚Äôt be working in this Lostbelt‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Jing Ke:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.So that‚Äôs it. A prayer was born into this world. Hope now springs forth in the hearts of people. That has become a path connected to the Throne of Heroes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Nezha:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah. This place, it‚Äôs no longer isolated from the Throne of Heroes.

In a forest, somewhere‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hm, this air smells nostalgic. The silhouettes of the mountains in the distance look familiar too.   
&gt;  
&gt;It looks like I have accepted a summoning to my homeland, but‚Ä¶   
&gt;  
&gt;What an inexplicable sight. There are no signs of the chaos of war in sight.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is no one around who looks like a Master either. In other words, we are stray servants, it seems. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Red Hare:**  
&gt;  
&gt;What a pity. I was longing to have a meeting that started off with me saying ‚ÄúI ask of you‚Äù, something like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Now then. What should I point out first? Your figure is‚Ä¶  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;What are you looking at? Of course, I‚Äôm Lu Bu Fengxian! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶Excusez moi? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Red Hare:**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no Heroic Spirit other than the Flying General, Lu Bu Fengxian, who would be summoned together with Chen Gong Gongtai, would there? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, but, you‚Äôre Red Hare, aren‚Äôt you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Red Hare:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Amongst men, Lu Bu, amongst horses, Red Hare! This form came to be because of my glorious martial valour through the union of man and horse, known to every household!   
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, this is the so-called Innocent Monster.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, there‚Äôs a carrot here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Red Hare:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Neigh! Where!? Where‚Äôs the delicious carrot!? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Chen Gong:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Hmmm. You are Red Hare after all.

tldr; it can't be your failure if it's not your fault.

Enjoy the read :)

&gt;1. Poe disobeyed orders and got The Resistance in trouble, which gets him demoted

Last time we saw Poe, he was being complimented for being ""one hell of a pilot"", and just a few hours before the First Order attack in TLJ we saw him blowing up Starkiller base.

That last feat shows us Poe is one of the best pilots in the galaxy, and outmaneuvering the FO's blasters should be even easier after catching them off guard with his ""yo mama"" jokes. Not only that happens, but he's actually able to create a small diversion. That sounds pretty successful to me.

It was NOT his fault the bombers turned out to be extremely slow. Poe made the right choice from a tactical standpoint. The bombers would have been slow to turn as well, and it would have ended as a sacrifice anyhow. If there's failure somewhere, it should be in whoever made the call on that attack. Leia maybe?

&gt;2. Poe failed by sending Rose and Finn to Canto Blight  
&gt;  
&gt;a. Poe didn't shut up and listen to Holdo

We've beaten this horse to death, so I'll be concise.

Holdo didn't inspire any leadership at all. Poe was right to distrust someone who was covering her own butt and not admitting the Resistance was not OSHA compliant in regards of escape pod maintenance.

&gt;2b. Finn and Rose didn't succeed.

At best this was Finn's failure. Poe just sent them on a mission. By that logic, the whole movie is Leia's failure.

&gt;3. Poe was stupid and led the Resistance to a dead end in Crait. Rey had to save them.

Well, excuse him for thinking the legendary wizard that appeared out of nowhere had entered thru the back door. At best, this was Luke's failure for not appearing behind the FO instead of from inside the cave. Even so, I always thought this was planned on Luke's part, because Rey had no reason to go to that back end of the cave either.

It feels more like the rescue was coordinated somehow.","Poe didn't ""fail"" at saving the Rebelsistance",1

I am working on building my first outdoor aquaponics system, and have an 8' x 4' x 1' plywood/2x12 grow bed, in which I've just installed a dura-skrim liner. I have a hole drilled in the wood for my auto-siphon, and just need to use a utility knife to carefully cut a hole in the liner, allowing me to install the [bulkhead I purchased](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLU1G5U/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) (for 1"" PVC). Going to be using 3/8"" to 5/8"" river stone gravel as my grow medium. However, I have a few questions about everything:

&amp;#x200B;

* Do I need to use any sort of sealant on the bulkhead, like run a bead of silicone or PVC cement between the dura-skrim and fitting? I've heard silicone doesn't stick very well to dura-skrim and am worried the cement might melt a hole in it, but I'm paranoid about leaks.
* Same question for the PVC pipe on both sides of the bulkhead fitting - should I PVC cement the pipes into the bulkhead or just rely on the slip fit?
* How do I attach the PVC media guard around my bell siphon to the dura-skrim? It's something like 10-12"" diameter PVC. I'm hesitant to put more holes in my liner but maybe I'll have to if no adhesives stick to it
* Do I need an overflow pipe in my grow bed if I'm using a bell siphon? My bell siphon standpipe will be 9"" above the grow bed floor (2"" solid collection zone, 7"" root zone), so I guess I'd put the overflow pipe at 11"" above the bed (after my 2"" dry zone), but again - if I don't need to drill another hole in my liner, I'd prefer not to.
* Anything else I might need to consider?

Thanks everyone, I'm pretty excited to get this up and running! I can add some pictures in the comments if anyone's curious.",Grow bed construction using Dura Skrim,1

The school (probably wisely) avoided holiday decor pertaining to any specific religion. It was only string lights and the occasional paper snowflake that decorated the halls, though some enterprising students took the opportunity to wear Santa hats and blast ""All I Want For Christmas is You"" throughout the hallways.

Vera smiled as she walked down the hallway, the holiday spirit near palpable as she made her way to her first period class. She had no clue what the Ancient Greeks had been doing around Christmas time, and so she put that thought off to the side, choosing to celebrate the holidays as is. 

Sure, she was kind of stressed. She had finals for her classes this week, and the college application deadline was looming ahead. But there was break, Christmas and her birthday next week, and hopefully Georgia and all the questers would be back soon. In all, there was a lot to look forward to.

An issue I've noticed within the last week with my team involves Windows Update Orchestrator superseding patches from WUA to install KB4478877 (released on 12/3), which is a security rollup that contains an updated version of KB4467684 (released on 11/26), which is breaking our end-user's ability to search within Outlook.

We're now seeing another new update, KB4471321 which is also pushing via Orchestrator instead of WUA.

My main purpose of coming to r/msp before going to r/sysadmin is just to see if others/other MSPs are seeing a similar issue, or if we need to continue to dig into our RMM (Automate) for results in addressing this or to reach out to Microsoft (lol.). The concern is that this set of patches is breaking searching within Outlook, and while we've automated a process of disabling these patches via Automate, they continue to push to our end-user workstations via Orchestrator.

Also she is kind of impolite (because she is dumb, not on purpose) - for example, she makes you wait at a specific restricted area for a long time, and the guards approach you first because she is making you wait for long (when she said she would be there quickly but forgot momentarily that it is restricted so she takes longer)? Or she has a soft voice so you do not her say please and thank you, and only replies to you online when she needs something, but gets away with everything because she pretends to be demure/shy by having a soft voice?

It's clearly very annoying as ive known this person for four years and it seems like she does not know basic social manners. And I'm afraid of offending her because she has a tendency to cry and act like a child (as I said, she has a very high pitched, soft, barely audible voice) when someone does something small to her that she feels is unwarranted but since she does not know basic manners, it is not actually unwarranted.

My wife is about to finish PT school, and we've tried to budget as best as we can without taking out student loans. I thought it would be better to put on the CC and get points, pay off gradually. But, about half of her school is left on the CC, coming to about $23K. She graduates in May and will be bringing in money once she gets a job this summer, and we can pay off even more at a time (she's been un-employed for the whole 3 years of school). My question is, would it be better to keep paying off the CC and then basically all of it once she gets a job? Or I could potentially take out half of my 401k in a loan, pay off the CC and then gradually put back into my 401k.  I know that having that money out of the 401k is taking away the earning power in the future, but I thought it might be worth it. Any advice is much appreciated.",Should I take a loan from my 401K?,1
699,The_Grey_Wolf,0,1545068596.0,0,t3_a71zbm,getdisciplined,"Hey guys,

about a year ago, I posted here saying that I daydream a lot. About 99% of my daydreams are about social interaction - going on dates, how I would act in certain social situations that could occur, talking to people over the phone or in real life, giving people advice etc. *Almost all of my daydreaming is focused on social interaction.* Also, sometimes, while I'm working out, I forget how many repetitions of an exercise I have done. 

*However, in my everyday life I function normally.* While I do have to write stuff down not to forget them and have other systems as to not to forget to do things, I function normally. For example, I completed a bachelors degree and am currently enrolled in a masters degree. I also have no problems in completing my tasks and seeing them through. 

That being said, I notice that while I study my mind quite often wanders away - e.g. I am programming, I get stuck for a little bit and all of a sudden I'm in my daydream, daydreaming about the next date I could have or the thing I could say to my cousin etc. etc. 

I have also been meditating for 20 minutes each day for more than a year now and that meditation is also unfocused, with my mind wandering like crazy. I also have specific times of day when I can go on the Internet to check my email or whatever (I've been slacking off on this lately, but mostly I go on the Internet in between my college lectures and once a day for a preset amount of time on my computer).  

**I just feel that, with all of my habits (i.e. meditation) and work ethic my focus should be better than average, not below average (which is what I deem it currently, because I daydream a lot).**

My questions for you:

* Any advice on this?
* How can I check if I have ADHD by myself (my friend borrowed me a book and based on that books test I do not have ADHD, but I could retest myself)?
* To which medical professional should I speak about this problem? (if necessary)

Thanks in advance!","[NeedAdvice] I don't think I have ADHD, but I have maladaptive daydreaming - I daydream A LOT! How to mitigate this?",1

How long were you asleep during the Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse movie? The music, the story, and the message were phenomenal in Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. I could never see any other movie five times like I did this one. Go back and see it a second time and pay attention.

? Watch Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse Movie WEB-DL This is a file losslessly ripped from a streaming service, such as Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Crunchyroll, Discovery GO, BBC iPlayer, etc. This is also a movie or TV show downloaded via an online distribution website, such as iTunes. The quality is quite good since they are not re-encoded. The video (H.264 or H.265) and audio (AC3/Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse C) streams are usually extracted from the iTunes or Amazon Video and then remuxed into a MKV container without sacrificing quality.

¬Æ Download Movie Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse One of the movie streaming industry‚Äôs largest impacts has been on the DVD industry, which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization of online content. The rise of media streaming has caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies such as Blockbuster. In July 2015 an article from the New York Times published an article about Netflix‚Äôs DVD services. It stated that Netflix is continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which is a significant drop from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming services have 65 million members. In a March 2016 study assessing the ‚ÄúImpact of Movie Streaming over traditional DVD Movie Rental‚Äù it was found that respondents do not purchase DVD movies nearly as much anymore, if ever, as streaming has taken over the market. Watch Movie Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse , viewers did not find movie quality to be significantly different between DVD and online streaming. Issues that respondents believed needed improvement with movie streaming included functions of fast forwarding or rewinding, as well as search functions. The article highlights that the quality of movie streaming as an industry will only increase in time, as advertising revenue continues to soar on a yearly basis throughout the industry, providing incentive for quality content production.

? Watch Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse Movie Online Blu-ray or Bluray rips are encoded directly from the Blu-ray disc to 1080p or 720p (depending on disc source), and use the x264 codec. They can be ripped from BD25 or BD50 discs (or UHD Blu-ray at higher resolutions). BDRips are from a Blu-ray disc and encoded to a lower resolution from its source (i.e. 1080p to 720p/576p/480p). A BRRip is an already encoded video at an HD resolution (usually 1080p) that is then transcoded to a SD resolution. Watch Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse Movie BD/BRRip in DVDRip resolution looks better, regardless, because the encode is from a higher quality source.

I've been playing for most of Bestiary, some of Incursion, and now back for Betrayal. Every time I've played, I've run in to the same issue with chasing the elder and I can't tell if I'm doing something wrong, or if its as clunky and complicated as it seems. 

My current scenario: 

On my current atlas, I've finished 3/15 of the memory fragments and need to do an Elder Influenced T9 map. 

Conservatory (T7) is Elder

Sepulchre (T8) is Shaper

Arena (T9) is Shaper (with a Shaper stronghold -- not sure what these are yet)

So my understanding of what I have to do is that I have to beat Sepulchre to turn it Elder. Then, I need to beat Arena, to turn it Elder. Then, I need to get another map to complete it as Elder. 

Then, once I beat that elder map, it'll turn back to Shaper and Leyline (T10) would also become shaper. At that point, I need to beat Arena a 4th time, and then do the exact same thing starting at Leyline -- beat it 4 times in a row to move up to T11. 

Is this correct? Beating each map 4 times in a row to progress through the questline would be alright, but the problem comes down to maps and losing influence for me. The trading system is so bad that I've spent the last 20 minutes on the offical POE trading site messaging people with Sepulchre maps to no response. 

Plus, if I decide I want go put that on hold for now and go run some other maps to see if I can get a lucky map drop, I risk losing the shaper/elder influence on my T7/T8 maps, which then sets me back even further. 

I feel pretty trapped, as in, I can't run any maps except for the correctly influenced ones, which then means I need to troll around trading sites messaging people all day. 

Am I missing something? Is this really how the system works? ",Chasing the Elder -- some questions from a newer player on The Memory Eater questline.,1

I made very basic version of a Video Game Testing Challenge website:  

[https://glitchplay.com/](https://glitchplay.com/)  

‚Äã

As a former professional QA game tester, I noticed there is no place on internet where you can practice hunting game bugs - in a way where you can verify your results.  

‚Äã

So the idea here is to have just 3 bugs on a very simple game. You can hunt bugs for free. But if you don't find them, you can buy the solution with the list of bugs.  

The bugs will eventually be randomized.  

‚Äã

Maybe you want to practice, maybe you just enjoy finding bugs? Maybe it's just a stupid idea?  

I'm trying to find out, so any feedback is appreciated  ",I made this QA Game Testing Challenge website,1

My legs are also really long so it is hard to reach with a razor to get it so I just usually Nair it off (plus it grows back slower when I do this I noticed). In the summer when I usually wear shorts, I have to shave often, but in the winter, I wear pants so I let it grow out. Well, I am starting pole classes again so I'll be wearing shorts which means that I will expose my hairy legs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have no doubt I won't be judged for having hairy legs, but I'm just wondering from the people with hairy legs is if it interferes with the gripping on the pole at all because if it does I will probably have to shave. In the event I was performing or something, I probably would shave anyways, but yeah, I'm just wondering.",To shave or not to shave?,1

It's an older oil furnace and we have baseboard heating, so the hot pipes don't help.  We've also had a couple plumbers come in for other repairs and mention that there is no fresh air intake for the furnace and the only reason we've passed inspection is that it's grandfathered in.  They really didn't mention anything beyond maybe putting in a louvered door.  We really wouldn't want to do that because the furnace is noise enough as it is.

It better be something unique and new, not some other copy or pure counter to another card (s). A leaked card Wolf Rider is coming, but this is just another excuse/chance for supercell to lessen The new card better not be:

1. Another way to spawn barbarians, skeletons or goblins (or in another form) 
Cards that fit in this category:
- Barbarian Barrel (another way to spawn a barbarian)
- Goblin Giant (another way to spawn Spear Goblins and Giant)
- Royal Hogs (Take away the rider and BOOM - New Card!)
- A leaked card ""Goblin Drill"". If it was implemented, it would be another way to spawn goblins

2. Another card with ""Royal"" in the name (ex: Royal Recruits, Royal Hogs, Royal Giant, Royal Ghost"")

3. A card in which it's only purpose in the Clash Royale World is is to lessen the usage rate of a dominated/popular card (which is usually the case)
(The possible new card,"" Wolf Rider's purpose is not to be a brand new card but is just an excuse to break Hog Rider users - Royal Hogs Succeeded, but not in ladder)
Cards that fit this category:
a) Giant Snowball - Tried to Dominate Zap and somewhat failed
b) Barbarian Barrel - Dominated the Log and after a ton of buffs, it succeeded
c) Goblin Giant - Tried to Dominate Giant Cards
d) Royal Recruits - Their only existence is to beat 3 Musketeer Users
e) Electro Dragon - Although borrowed from Clash Of Clans, it's only existence is to retarget Infernos (I may be wrong on this)
f) Royal Hogs - Tried to Dominate Hog Rider and Succeeded in Challenges but not ladder.
g) The possible Wolf Rider card - Another excuse to attempt to break Hog Rider users 

4. A card with the word Magic, Giant, ROYAL, Wizard, Dragon, or whatever in the name of the card (ex: ELECTRO Dragon, Goblin GIANT, ROYAL recruits). This point is a reference to the 2nd Point.


This is ridiculous, Supercell. I may have forgotten some cards, but you got the point. I know that it is very difficult to create new mechanics for new cards, but if the new card's purpose is to be another copy or counter to another card, what's the joy in that.

809,skinnypup,0,1545068576.0,0,t3_a71z7f,Cruise,"So we just finished our Symphony of the Seas cruise, and though we're not cruise people...we definitely enjoyed the trip, and were extremely impressed by the ship and its crew (particularly our dining room waiters and room attendant).  

Just a one gripe though - and I'm not including the crappy, expensive internet as it was expected:

Smoking sections.  There's two main areas that guests can smoke on the ship - one side of the swimming area on Deck 15, and one side of the Casino on Deck 4.  The Deck 15 area is somewhat okay because it's an open space and the smoke dissipates into the air (though you can still kind of smell it if you're close enough).  

However, the smoking area in the Casino sucks...as you can smell it as you're going up/down the stairs towards Deck 4 on Aft side.  And the smell just resides there right in front of the Main Dining Room entrance and into the area where people line up to get into the dining room - only getting worse and more stale as the days go by.  I remember walking through the Casino the first day, and thinking ""why does it smell like smoke?  Surely, smoking isn't allowed on the ship, right?""

I was hoping they would have dedicated boxes/rooms (like they have in Japan) for smokers so that they can do their thing without affecting others.  But I understand the placement of the smoking section in the Casino: $$$$.  It's just too bad that there isn't better ventilation or air filtration to prevent the smoke from wafting outside of the casino or into the non-smoking section of the casino.

Anyways, other than that...it was a great trip, which I would highly recommend to anyone - even for non-cruise people, as it's a great way to just relax and do nothing.  You can always use the ports to do your own hiking as we did in St. Kitts.

One other tip: when paying taxi drivers, make sure to pay in exact change if possible (including tip).  I gave a driver $40 for a $22 trip and asked for change...he muttered something, went back to his cab, and drove away....this was in St. Thomas.",My only gripe on latest cruise (Symphony of the Seas),1

848,LoseIt_Throwaway92,1,1545068567.0,0,t3_a71z5r,loseit,"Including people I haven't seen in ages, such as my aunt who lives on a different continent, and my former pediatrician (who I saw for the first time in 6 years, a couple of weeks ago).

I started my weight loss journey in August 2017, after having my gallbladder removed at the tender age of 24 (but my SW is from about a month and a half earlier). I've lost about 50 pounds since then, the first 30 or so mostly through CICO, and have been in quasi-maintenance for about 2 months now (I'm not done though; I still want to lose between 13-16 pounds, depending on which fluctuating number I see on any given day). But, it seems like my body composition is still changing, because suddenly, everyone in my life has started to notice and comment on my weight loss.

A few weeks ago, I had to take my niece to the pediatrician (the same one I used to see), and literally the first thing she said to me was ""oh wow, you lost weight!"" I had no idea it was that apparent, especially since the last time I saw her was before I put on all that weight... the last time I saw her, I was maybe ten pounds heavier than I am now.

My neighbor, who I've seen most days, all of a sudden said ""you've lost a ton of weight, haven't you?"" the other week, when we made small talk as I was leaving the house. I've been living at home this year, and this is a neighbor I've known my whole life, and again... had no clue it was so obvious. Rinse and repeat with my sister who is away for college (hugs me, and says ""your waist is way thinner!"", the last two times we've seen each other), and my aunt who's visiting from another country, and haven't seen in 4 years (literally the first thing she commented on, and I wasn't even close to my largest the last time I saw her).

Just... I don't know, it's weird that I'm suddenly getting all this attention for it, but it feels good at the same time? I've always been really bad at being able to tell when people have lost weight, including myself, and I sometimes feel like I'm still at my largest - even though, logically, I know that's impossible. I guess it's the paper towel effect coming into play, but I never thought I'd experience it this much, and when I'm still relatively far from my goal weight.

I'm also going on vacation for Christmas, and will be wearing a bikini for the first time in my life, which is both exciting and terrifying. Hopefully my stomach isn't really as big as I sometimes feel like it is haha (because phantom fat and me sucking at seeing weight loss), but after resigning myself to one pieces my whole life, I wanted to challenge myself to reach a place where I could pull off a bikini. Here's hoping I don't see those vacation pictures and cringe!",NSV: everyone and their mother has noticed (and new bathing suits!),1

My husband and I are expecting for May 2019. This will be our first child. :D   
We have a tiny 2002 Turbo VW Beetle, and I'm curious if there are any mom's out there that would recommend a car seat and stroller set that actually fit in the tiny car.   


My husband is thinking about just getting some type of rack, like a bike rack but for strollers.   


I almost want to start looking into what it would take to get a different car (we just bought a house so more debt on top of Mat leave isn't making me feel great.)  


Any advice or stories of your experience with a tiny car (Beetle specifically) and car seats and strollers would be greatly appreciated.

So my bf and I started dating in senior year of highschool. He had been dating an older college girl for a couple years then this very leggy secret bad girl before we started dating.

I was the shy kinda nerdy new girl. My family moved to town halfway through my junior year where I had already skipped a grade. I'm only 5'4"" with blonde hair, blue eyes, and 34c breasts, but I think I have killer legs and butt from a lifetime of gymnastics, dance and martial arts. 

My bf and I met when we were both padding our college applications with involvement in student government, and our student parking was next to each other. Talking became flirting, and I could he was a pretty dominant guy. I was still a virgin, and not able to really date thanks to a super religious and overprotective dad. 

However, my bf was really clever, and would come over to my house after school a lot to work on student government projects and work on homework. He never made a move and spent a lot of time charming my parents. He still was seeing the brunette and was just feeding this sexual tension. We started talking about sex more and more, including his promiscuity and my virginity but never more.

Finally I was asked out on a movie date by this awkward but good looking guy on the baseball team. I told my bf, and he started picking on me and teasing me ruthlessly, saying how I was never going to have sex again if this guy was my first. Im really getting hurt and pissed off, and I defensively snap back ""well at least he is actually interested in me!"". He looks at me with a smile and pure confidence and says ""who says I don't"" and he grabs the back of my head and pulls me into his and starts making out with me! Holy Shit he is good. I'm sucked by this turn of events, surprised that he just went for it, and excited because I've wanted this for so long. He is working me like a musician. He's started slow and delicate but doesn't allow time for me to say anything. Everytime I kids back he takes it deeper and further, until he is fucking my mouth with his. 

My parents had an upstairs den in our house where they let us work and hang out. They had become so comfortable with us together now that they would let us hang out there alone. Both of my parents were working late, and my sister was at a friend's house. 

Now he is pulling me into him, his hands gentle but strong and firm, crushing my buddy into his. I straddle his lap. We keep making out. I feel his hands massaging my ass. He now has a bulge in his pants and he is grinding it against me. I'm wearing a navy JCrew skirt that's hiked up now so it's only my panties and his pants so his humping is hitting my clit like crazy. Before this I would get off by aiming my clit at the running water in my tub and I had confessed this to my bf, so he is focusing on my clit with total precision. 

As this is happening, and I'm feeling an orgasm coming, he is playing with his zipper. Shit! I think. He's trying to push this as far as he can go! It should have been a red flag, but I had been restricted for so long in my life, that I had never experienced a man trying to use me. It was thrilling! I didn't do anything to so him and soon I felt his bare cock running against my panties. The ridge of his penis head rubbing me just right on my clit. 

Now we have stopped making out and we are looking into each other's eyes. He is caressing my hair and running his hands up and down my body. He says, ""I love feeling how excited you are"" as he continues humping his dick against my wet panties. I'm lost in his eyes and his touch and I want to take him from his gf. I want to be his. 

I reach behind and grab his dick then tuck it inside my panties and rub against his dick. ""I want to be yours! I want to be your girlfriend!"". 

He is moaning ""so do I!"". 

I rub his head in my folds. ""I don't want to do this with &lt;baseball player&gt;""

""He will never please you like me""

""And &lt;brunette&gt; will never feel this good""

""No she doesn't. I want you""

With that I sit down on his cock impaling my own hymen. The pain is sharp but I mask it with a moan. I am fully invested in this moment. I've never felt this sexy in my life. I've never felt sexy, and I'm drunk off my butt on it. He is moaning, and yelling ""oh God!"" And that is turning me on like crazy. I start slowing riding him taking long awkward strokes up and down his shaft. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I can't do anything sing at this point so I go with what feels right. I'm right too because the look on his face now is that one where a man is fighting to not cum. I love it. I'm getting close but I need him deeper. I sit-down on his dick and start grinding so against him. He is now rocking into me and grinding his pelvis against my clit. I start having this really intense orgasm and press into him, hugging his buddy tight. I feel him tensing under me and trying to push out of me, but I'm cumming so hard my body is shaking and I'm weeping. He finally gives up and hold me tight against him.

I finally come to. He asks if I'm okay and apologizes, thinking I was crying about my virginity. I tell him no, I was just so overwhelmed by the time I came that my body and emotions lost control. I can see that this feeds his confidence. 

I can feel his seed in me. He came a lot I can tell because creamy globs are sleeping through my panties. Luckily I was about to have my period, so I didn't get pregnant this time. But we had become instantly obsessed with the feeling of him cumming inside me.

So on the day of our first kiss. I get my first boyfriend, lose my virginity and get a lifelong fetish for getting bred.",Oops...my virginity,1

Let's say I want to estimate a parameter with a survey. I have to choose between two possible surveys.

Both have the same expected value.

One survey is simple but vague. I expect to get a lot of answers (N\_1) with high variance (sigma\_1).

The other survey is precise but tedious. I expect to get few answers (N\_2) with low variance (sigma\_2).

If I want a given confidence interval, are both surveys equal if there is the same ratio between `sqrt(N_1) / sqrt(sigma_1)` and `sqrt(N_2) / sqrt(sigma_2)` ?

I'm 50, 270, huge family history of gout, had it before I was 30, drank, soda, junkfood etc...

I eat better now, but still drink, eat rich food, red meat, whatever I want. I take vit C, a multi, a joint &amp; bone supplement, and have had no gout in 1 year. I believe our body is breaking down, at that minuscule vascular level, in our joints, and constantly needs to be repaired. We don't provide nutrients for our body to do it, and so it fails and yes, uric acid rich blood probably reacts to that as well. Just my bro science! But after 20+ years of constant trial and error, frustration, I finally feel free of that. And am so compelled to share. 

I hope this helps. It is expensive, but it doesn't just free one of frustrating debilitating gout, it gives you back your life and health and fun. Hope you try it out, try a bit at a time. Try just a multi fo a month? Maybe that's all you need? Then vit C? Then joint? Then bone supplement? See how it goes. Hoping this helps cuz gout is a huge downer. ",Gout Free For A Year...so far,1

I started graduate school in Fall 2018 and paid out $6000 of my own money for the Fall 2018 semester. My company is going to pay back 100% of costs, however, it won't be processed until January 18th. Does the tax-free max of $5250 count for 2018 or 2019?

I have another $3000 to spend per semester from this point on, but if Fall 2018's reimbursement is counted under 2019's tax-free max of 5250, that means I'm potentially gaining $3750 of taxable income for 2019 just because my company reimbursed me the following year.

I'm currently testing ways to make a variant calling pipleine more accurate. One of the things I'm trying is setting the ""--dont-use-soft-clipped-bases"" in (GATK 4) Mutect2 to ""true"". I'm testing all of my own samples with and without the option on, but I was just wondering if anyone has much experience using this option? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's set to ""false"" by default, and what I have gathered is that the reason for this is that it's expected that soft clipped bases will be used for local realignment and indel calling, but setting it to true seems to have little impact on the number of indels called, in my dataset anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

932,BeastCraiser,0,1545068550.0,0,t3_a71z2e,headphones,"A bit of a back story: In the last 6 months or so I was in the search of a new headphone. My Main goal was to find a closed headphone which is very comfortable for long listening sessions. My ears seem to stick out a little bit more than the standard and I am very sensitive to anything touching my ears. My selection came down to the Sennheiser HD 598CS and the Sony MDR1A. After purchasing both and a week of testing, I came to the conclusion, that I like the Sound of the Sennheiser more. I also liked the size of the big earcups, but there is a little bump in the earcups (Sennheisers says it is for a better soundstage?) with touches my ears, resulting in pain for me after about an hour or so. Also the stiffness of the Pads seems very hard (especially compared to the Sonys). After nearly sending both back I stumbled upon the topic of replacing Pads for increased comfort.

I really liked the impressions of the Brainwavz pads, an wanted to know if those may fix my problems. After some research I would probably choose the Hybrid or the Pleather versions. Because the Sennheisers have their proprietary mount system I looked for an adapter and found one on modhouseaudio which is advertised to work with the combination (pretty expensive for 25$ after shipping). I have heard some negative impressions for the combination of HM5 pads with open back Sennheisers, but dont know if the same applies to the CSs. I dont mind muddiing the highs and boosting the lows a little, but Id really like to retain the soundstage.

I would be very happy to hear some thoughts on the topic as I cant really test the setup beforehand. Has anyone tried the combination? And are the brainwavz pads more comfortable the the stock sennheisers?

Thanks in advance :)

I really enjoyed doing the Hivemind puzzle and am glad they added something so unique in the way that it functions.
Currently there are bugs in the game related to who can use the Hivemind but based on @Celestalon‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/1074489992548765696?s=09 it appears that the intended way it should work is that you can only use the mount with the characters you completed the puzzle with. 

Due to the fact that the mount gives you the ability to travel as a group at increased speeds, it has a clear advantage for people who are able to use it together. By limiting the mount usage to only toons that completed it together it gives a clear advantage to groups of 5 that can play together all the time. 

1. Instanced PvP- especially in battlegrounds it is an advantage for a group who can group up and have increased speed to get the flags faster or gank players who are slower due to not having a Hivemind. My personal stance on this is that you should not be able to join someone else's Hivemind in an instanced PvP situation. 

2. Mythic+ - the increased speed can help in some situations where you can mount which is helpful if you are only running M+ with the same 5 person group, but many people have more than 5 people that they rotate through depending on who is available or pug people for their keys. The increased speed could be the difference in completing in time or not 

3. Open world content - in the open world you have plenty of opportunities for grouping up with random people to help out with whatever content may be occurring. The main thing to consider is world PvP. A group of people in the Hivemind can easily gank someone and I find many times the zone chat will fill with people interested in grouping and fighting back,  but that gives the disadvantage to the group that cannot mount the Hivemind and chase the group in the Hivemind down due to the fact that they are just a ragtag group that happened to find each other and decided to work together. 

4. Multi-boxers- multi-boxers already have an advantage over others by having multiple toons ready to fight together. By giving them this mount, they have another advantage over others if they complete the puzzle with their group of toons.

5. Guilds/friend groups- I have about 7 people that I consistently do content with on top of the people of my guild that I raid with. I understand that the solution currently proposed is that you can redo the puzzle with a new group to get to the group you currently desire to group with, but that is an awful lot of work to go through each time you decide you want to be able to group with a different friend. The current way it is designed to work means you have to decide which people you don't want in your group, effectively forming unnecessary cliques and leaving others out. If this stays in place, anyone who wants to obtain the Hivemind mount through a pug group is going to have a more difficult time finding a due to people needing to be selective of who can be in their Hivemind. 

Conclusion: the Hivemind does have many advantages that should be evaluated, but in my opinion limiting who is able to group with who is  not the solution to making sure this mount is not overpowered. By limiting it in this regard you create the advantage for any 5 man that consistently groups together over any random groups that form to do the same content.",Why the Hivemind restrictions should be reevaluated,3

To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels.  Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the ""loser,"" and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.  When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3x5 card reading, ""Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.""
