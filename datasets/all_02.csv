7,kmopm,0,1545074754.0,0,t3_a72yw3,FIFA,"He outstanding shooting. 87 shooting in the card with good traits and 5 star week foot. He also has a very decent passing and decent dribbling.
However he is slow 65 off pace and Is not super strong. He has something like 66 off physical.

I play in a 4231(2) with him as the sole striker. I thing the instruction run behind of the defence makes no sense for him because of his pace and strength. Y have tryed with the standard instruction and he is good. He made 101 goals in 149 matches. But I think I am not getting all the juce. I want him to step a little behind the defence so he can shoot properly. I create a lot of good chanses with my 5 middlefields. And the function I want him to have is to pick the ball and put it in the net. 

However to accomplish this. What is better. False 9 or the target man instruction?

so i’ve been following this thread for a while because i have felt as though i was a textbook case of BPD for the past year since i did research about it. i’ve been struggling to get any kind of diagnosis for 2 years, however i finally got diagnosed today with BPD, anxiety and depression. i was scared that i would mess up my diagnosis by thinking i have BPD when it could be something else, however he asked all the questions and came to the conclusion himself, so when I was told I had BPD, i was still a little shocked because i hadn’t claimed it(?if that makes sense).

now i don’t know how to feel. i feel hopeful because i’ve done my research and know what i have to do to start this healing process or whatever, however i’m scared because based on research, i know it’s gonna be a long process. 

so yeah, i just wanted to post to welcome myself? and get as much advice as i can.",newly diagnosed!,1

###How do I become verified?  

1. Take a pic of you showcasing that phat booty. Pics must be of you standing and showing your ass from the back but can be at a slight angle. No bending over/forward, closeup shots, lying down, frogbutts, topdown shots, leg raised up, pants coming up to your ass cheek shots or any other angle or camera trick to try and deceive us. We must be able to see all of that ass. Examples: [pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/xTYU48x.jpg), [pic 2.](https://i.redd.it/gthu98x7qx021.jpg)  **Absolutely no photoshop**!

2. You must also be holding a piece of paper with your **handwritten** reddit username, name of this sub and today's date (date when you are verifying). The paper must be crumpled then smoothed back out.  

3. Send the pic to us in a **modmail**. Do not post it in the sub.

4. Please be sure you do indeed have a phat ass before sending us any pics. After all that is what this sub is for. There are many other subs out there dedicated to asses but this one is for phat asses. Remember, big ≠ phat, there needs to be some shape to it. Read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pawg/comments/9li3w3/psa_rules_will_now_be_more_heavily_enforced_here/) before starting the verification process.

###What comes with being verified?  

1. You get a ""Verified PAWG"" user flair. Any post you make here will have that flair on your username. You also become an approved submitter. 

2. You will be allowed to promote your personal subreddit, tumblr, pornhub etc **EXCEPT** for any platform that allows sales. Such platforms include but not limited to: patreon, manyvids, clip stores, etc and will result in an immediate ban from our sub. Snapchat and kik are also prohibited.

3. You will be allowed an exception to our ""Perception/Ass assist"" flair. In other words, all those angles mentioned above will be available to you. Reason being, if you're verified, it means that you have a phat ass and no camera angle is going to change that. Let's be honest, it is one of the most annoying flairs since a lot of pics are taken from these kinds of angles, yet it's also one of our most necessary rules. All the more reason for being verified so the mods don't have to constantly go back through your post history to check.   

##So send us your pics today if you want to be one of our Verified PAWG's and do enjoy the season.",🎄 Tis the season for Verification 🎅,1

In 2018, the City Manager's office increased again by 1/3 to add Gang Prevention, Homeless Services, and Cannabis Policy/Enforcement staff.

90,MisterSpartacusJr,0,1545074739.0,0,t3_a72ysz,askgaybros,"I started having sex with guys in my teens and came out in college.  Never had sex with a woman, never dated a woman, really never even hung out much with women.  I haven't had the best record with relationships -- I tended to have sex with hook-ups and my relationships with my friends (who were occasional hookups, too).  My most serious relationship was not very sexual -- my BF eventually left me because he wanted something more passionate.  My main sexual outlet in recent years has been masturbation -- often to porn -- gay, straight, bi, trans, lesbian, you name it.  My emotional life is really about my friends, who are almost exclusively gay men.  I've also been really active in the gay community more broadly.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few years, I've found myself more fascinated by the idea of sex with women.  (I would say that I am attracted to both sexes  - growing up I could find both guys and girls hot, but my crushes were always on other boys).  So, several months ago, I arranged to have sex with a female prostitute while visiting another city.  I loved it!  I've done this several times since, but I know that it's not a sustainable model -- I don't have that kind of money.  But I'm now in the awkward position of realizing that I prefer men emotionally (I have almost no female friends) but women sexually.  Nobody else knows about this.

I don't know what I should do now.  I think if I ""came out"" about my interest in women I might lose a lot of my friends.  My ideal world might be: have sex with women (with no commitment beyond FWB) but love my male friends.  But I doubt many women would be up for that.  My bi and straight male friends have often complained about the difficulty of having sex with women without emotional commitment.  I really don't know what I could offer to a woman romantically.  And my few female friends are mostly married.  I know that most women won't date bi men, let alone one who has lived his life as gay.  (Most of the bi guys I've known have either remained closeted or decided to live their lives as gay men, and just beat off to straight porn or something).  I'm decent looking, but pushing into middle age, and I doubt that I could pick up women just for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I want to utilize two 8x slots with two different raid cards.  This will allow me to have the full speed of my drives without saturating the PCI/SATA connections.  I believe the R720 can be configured with two seperate 8 - Bay 2.5 inch backplanes.  **Does anyone know if I can just buy 2 8 -slot backplanes and swap them in place of the 16-slot backplane?**

163,winnabenna,0,1545074727.0,0,t3_a72yq5,mentalillness,"I (24 F) recently started seeing a therapist again in September after years of going without one. I am no stranger to counseling as I started when I was about 4 or 5. The last time I saw a therapist was probably 2012 or 2013 and I just went back to my childhood psychiatrist. 

This year I found one doctor and went to a few appointments before realizing she was NOT for me. So I just cancelled my next appointment and never went back. Easy. Then I started doing online therapy (video chat). I really thought I enjoyed this person but the past few appointments have been very disappointing. She can’t stay on topic, has taken a very long time to fax a referral for a psychiatrist, is almost always late, seems to be somewhat judgmental (or at-least makes me feel like it). I’ve been trucking through but tonight I have an appointment and I am dreading it. The last three or four sessions we discussed literally nothing. I even got frustrated and very annoyed last time because more than half of the appointment she spent looking for my referral letter on her computer. I’m obviously shy to speak up and afraid of confrontation (hello anxiety) which is why I am turning here. I don’t know how to say this isn’t working out and obviously in person I would probably just ghost...but I feel like that’s not an easy option since we text and have a standing appointment time. 

So, any advice?

TLDR: I don’t think my online therapist is the right fit anymore and I am unsure on how to “break up” with them. ",Advice on ”breaking up” with your therapist?,1

1. [Ghost Stories - Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_9AT_psOvjpHZPWq25uRg5BYFJINAcAj). (Synth pop) This album’s atmosphere is absolutely stunning. The soft synths and beautiful melodies constantly shine throughout the album. Every song fits perfectly in the album. When you need to relax, this is the perfect album to listen to

2. [The 2nd Law - Muse](https://youtu.be/GMD05k7zgPE) (Dubstep/alt rock) Every song in this album is well written and incredible unique. One moment you could be listening to hard rock, the next you could be listening to EDM. This album takes you on an adventure

3. [The Division Bell - Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYe_yAiX89Y1Hbf5l6bcrMdscFDEBLx53) (Prog Rock).

My husband has had a lot thrown at him in the last few years and is now experiencing a renewal of his faith, so much so that he plans to be baptized at our new independent contemporary/casual church at the end of the month. 

I am not as far long in my own faith journey but want to support him in his, and would like to get him a Christmas gift that reflects that support. Can anyone help me with ideas? He has a nice bible that he likes. The only idea I have is a bible case/organizer (for the Bible, small notebook, pen, etc) that I could maybe have personalized with his name and/or baptism date. Any other suggestions? Something in the sub-$50 range would be ideal.

What seems to be pain points about team mates in past games that I've played (15 years experience from DotA 1 and 2, LoL, HoN, and Hots) seem to be a given with you folks. People regularly pick teams with an element of each role in them. They prioritize the objective over all else. They back off when out numbered, they stay behind tanks and protect healers. They hand out endorsements and kudos in the post game on the regular. They rarely talk shit to the other team across all chat. They communicate well with pings (I play with voice chat off since I don't want to be treated like a moron for being new and adjusting). Just yesterday I played with a group that had a good round and all 6 voted to stay as a team and we played 5 games in a row, all wins, and I received multiple friend requests.

During 8 years, public library in a extremely poor district was one of my part-time job :I worked 60 hours minimum by week wiht two others job but I can said librarian was my most crazy and unpleasant job I have. Mostly, the place attracted both normals readers and extremely hardcore weirdos. In 8 years and happily not all days, I encountered tramps savage concerts, thieves, perverts, religious extremists, arsonists, really deviants people,prostitution (it was one time, during my first week), dealers, gangs reckoning, cops under cover, much more until  a murder attempt. the main building was quickly decrepit, but because it was a part of the electoral showcase of the mayor(open during all the week, with internet and hearher), the administation refuse to do something: if something gone wrong it was probably our fault as they said. Plus, ayear after our openning, when someone displeased some officials, or commit important craps, you could be sure he will found easely a place among our staff. My sister call me a liar until I get her a job here right for her and she started to give same stories as me to her friends. We are a totally free service (internet, books, sessions, etc.). some people were gratefuls, other, well... not really gratefuls. 8 years for me at the heart of madness.

I will just start with a common reader problem: the liar and the book return policy.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a tall man, so, easely, most of my co workers asked me to deal with some problems (AKA scary people). I remember a guy who was isnt scary but he was avoid by most of my staff for the loan service. So,yup, look like it was my turn to meet him directly. He speaked nicely with a condescending tone. I am a guy who speak frankly and friendly (it avoid to me some pettiness of my coworkers, and some readers were just lonely people who wanted someone to speak). So, when the reader come, he dropped almost 30 books on the table plus his library card.

Me: ""well, I'm sorry, sir, but you cant take so much books for this time (a reader can just keep for three weeks 10 books)

Him: oh, no, its not a problem. You can put them on my card

I checkec his card, the guy have almost 135 books plus dvds on his account and some were asked for return since two years. I laughed a bit by surprise.

M: riiiiiiight. I definitely sorry sir, but you cant borrow anything today. More, I will say you need to return to us a large part of our collection.

H: I dont understand. I've never meet any problems until today.

M: as you said, sir, but today, things are differents. You cant borrow books, you just have to return it.

H: maybe if I give you my other card.

Generally, I confront problems because, well, you cant just let things like this. Some of my coworkers were behind me, drinking some coffee, pretend to hear nothing. If the reader can have an other card (from one of his family members) and if this card was empty, yes, I forced to let him borrow some books. But no, the guy drop me his visiting card, ""Mr. Someone, Minister of the Interior"". I was surprised. He smiled.

But...

H: im sorry, sir, but actually, only library card work. 

It was not a big deal. At this moment, all of my coworkers leave with an urgent need to clean the bookshelves.

H: NO! Flip the card!

I do that. It was his minister email. Some of my colleagues were impressionables people, so it didnt help us in most of situations. It was a true visiting card, and reader fil confirm. The guy just pretend he was someone important as the minister

M: I really sorry again sir. Email dont work. 

The man started to fulminate; since he was here, he got no problem, my covorkers let him take books etc etc. so its not him who got a problem, but me. ETC. The guy stopped to speak. He screamed. He wanted to turn a dumb but avoidable situation into a whole circus. people around love that.  It wasnt the first time I was confronted with this kind of situation. My big brother was the school lil'terror, and I suffered his classmates revenge, even a lot of teachers revenge from years. So I used to it. The guy just insult me and tried to make my blood boils. He was just a bastard, but well, I used to it.

He dropped: YOU WANT SOMEONES TO SPEAK?? FINE! he take his visiting card and written furiously something. he smashed the pen mine at the end, in the table, and give me another email, the name of the director of the cabinet of the minister at the time. I shrugged my shoulders.

  
H: I will make a phone call  about you to the mayor.

M: Aaaaand I will make a phone call to your most terryfying minister, the IRS.

&amp;#x200B;

He leave. My coworker thanks me for dealing with this reader but let me tidy all of his books. Every time I think about this guy, I didnt think I really helped my coworkers, because, each time there was a problem with some people, the called me to fix the shit (sometimes I was beaten,even once, hitten by a guitar). Ah yes, the guy effectively written a letter to the mayor and pretend I tried to assaulted him, a poor functionnary, and some stuff. My first director helped me for that, and  nothing happened.

Three years ago, I opened a credit card with a red national Bank, with a credit limit of 2500. Due to vet bills and other ""sudden"" problems, I hit that limit pretty fast. I made payments as I could, but then I lost my jobs, found one, lost it, found another one that only barely let me make ends meet, let alone get caught up. Thanks to friends' generosity I was able to get caught up- but I couldn't pay the credit card bill still. 

Unbeknownst to me, the bank sent to card, after closing the account and waiting about six months, I suspect, to an attorney's office. They claim they sent a letter to my home address in Valdosta, where I applied for the card, but I didn't get it. 

Today, I have a sheriff knocking on my door and handing me a summons and complaint package. There's really nothing final about any of the paperwork, but I give the office a call. The lady I speak with does the usual spiel of this is an attempt to collect a debt and shit. After informing her of my financial information, she presents me with three different payment options, none of which are possible for me to do. 

What's the worst that can happen if I don't pay them? 

I am on probation for something different in Valdosta, but that is done this month, (December). Will this affect that? 

Am I right in thinking this is a heavy handed scare tactic?",Please help confirm my suspicions,0

""Wow,"" said Garfield, ""This lasagna looks good… Like really good. This sounds weird, but I'm getting feelings for this lasagna that I've never felt before. Feelings that are sexual."" Suddenly, Garfield had a massive boner. He beheld the boner with measured glee. Slightly right-biased and powerfully turgid, it glistened with sweet pre-jac like the morning dew. Oh how it glistened. Without thinking, compelled by an animal force, he buried his mega-bone in the hot I-talian treat. Just then, Jon, Garfieild's owner in a blue shirt, walked into the room. Note that the background is blue like in the comics. ""Argh!"" Jon said, as he tore at his hair. ""My life is ruined! Garfield, you shouldn't put your dick in other people's food! It's just not hygienic!"" Garfield wasn't going to take this from a little betch like Jon. ""Hey Jon, you betch. Stop being the worst human being. I think that when you die and go to hell, hell will just be a mirror, because that's what your hell would be; just being with you. That's what everyone's hell would be."" Except Garfield couldn't really say that because he has the graceless lips and tongue of a cat – Garfield cannot actually talk. ""That's just not fair! Not only do you have to show off your large, admittedly magnificent dick, licks lips you also have to put it in my food! Grr, it's not fair! You get everything and now I find out that your anatomy is better then mine! All the girls would like me so much better if I had that glorious, Zeus of a Cock of yours…"" Jon then looked at a fruit bowl on his table. He noticed a banana in between two apples. Suddenly he started glowing. ""Hey… I know! Oh Garfield, do you want to do a favor for me? I have a date at seven today and I want to impress my date… Like really impress her."" Garfield understands none of this. He is a cat. His feline brain is not sophisticated enough to process more than ""eat lasagna"" and ""violate lasagna."" Thus, he does not comprehend the dark machinations of Mr. Arbuckle, who plans to impress his date by also fucking the lasagna. Just then Nermal came out of nowhere. ""Hey Garfield, I came to visit you!"" Garfield hates Nermal because he's a little betch cat who thinks he's sooo much better then everyone so Garfield swung his dick and crushed Nermal with it. A grey goo was stained on his hard submarine like cock. Garfield looked at his dick with pride. ""You know what, you are so large and amazing I think I will call you… Moby Dick."" John's date arrives and he totally does not deliver. She opens the door, right? And he tries to fuck the lasagna, like the cat did. He didn't make new lasagna; she is not going to be impressed with jon's sloppy seconds. His pee-pee is not that great. It's like a sad earthworm. The kind that's like, on the sidewalk and is getting cooked by the sun because it was too stupid to realize that it's on concrete when it's raining John's a betch. Jon's date raised and eyebrow and looked bored. ""That's it? Betch-Please, I can do so much better than that.” Jon's date went to the refridgerater and started going ""Hrm…"" She took at a pineapple and gave it a whole blowjob. Garfield and Jon's mouth fell onto the floor in amazement. ""Holy cow,"" said Garfield. ""You couldn't even do that with a jolly rancher you sad fuck.” Then she took at every item from the refrigerator one by one and put it in her vagina. She took the sour cream and put it in her vagina. She took out a box of domino's pizza and put it in her vagina. She took out a large ham and put it in her vagina… im not explaining this. Look in your own refrigerator. See the stuff in there? She put it in her vagina. All of it from the soy milk to that giant container of kimchi. She then played with all of it in her vagina and put it back in the refrigerator. ""You see? That's how you fuck food."" After that, Jon's date left him because he's a sad little fuck Jon cried and cried and said, ""oh my god, why am I such a sad little faggot!?"" He then looked at his refrigerator and said, ""oh wait, she put all of that in her vagina… so if I had sex with all of the things in the refrigerator, it would be like having sex with her multiple times!"" John's face was filled with a smile and John spent the entire weekend having sex with all of the food stuff in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, Garfield and Odie had to eat everything that was fucked by Jon and his date. It smelled like goat Cheese and rotting cum.",Hey fellas,2

I'm a 30yr old male that has been lifting fullbody compound movements for the past few weeks. So far training is as follows.. basically...

Monday/ Wednesday/ Friday: Bent over Rows, Bench Press, Pullups, Military Press.. all barbell

Tuesday/ Thursday: Deadlift, Squats, Calf Raises

Im taking one scoop of wey after workouts everyday, I only eat a big dinner/ intermittent fast.

Im 5'9"" and weigh 215 before lifting started at 210ish. My question comes down to what caloric intake should I be shooting for? I used my fitness pal in the past and kept my intake at the 1500 mark and lost a byunch of weight which is great but I want to not only lose some fatty LBS but also look good. I don't have a target weight to achieve as I know while building muscle it's not so much of whats on the scale but appearance. If I had to shoot a number I think it should be between like 185-195? There is an overload of information on the internet about body recomp claims and fallacies as well as so many different diet and lifting programs. I just want advice on what caloric intake should I be at? is my lifting routines alright? supplements?

&amp;#x200B;

""Will it be possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone?""

""No. By creating the world market, big industry has already brought all the peoples of the Earth, and especially the civilized peoples, into such close relation with one another that none is independent of what happens to the others.

Further, it has co-ordinated the social development of the civilized countries to such an extent that, in all of them, bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes, and the struggle between them the great struggle of the day. It follows that the communist revolution will not merely be a national phenomenon but must take place simultaneously in all civilized countries – that is to say, at least in England, America, France, and Germany.""

I am sure lots of you have favourite porn stars, favourite amateur girls, and things that make them your favourite. I am also sure that you wouldn't say they are absolutely perfect though either. Maybe they are slightly too tall, their hair isn't quite right, their nipples are a bit too small for their breasts, etc.. Why don't we try and piece together what a perfect girl would look like for you. That way we can pick and choose each part. Maybe the legs from this picture, the butt from that, so on and so on. Once we are done maybe we can dress her or explore what you would do with her.

A lifelong bike rider who rode casually until just over five years ago, when I changed to a stay at home job.  Since then, my riding has increased gradually.  It began by riding between 20 - 25 miles a day, four to five days a week.  I justified the training time by the extra time gained from not driving to work.  After a couple of years of doing that I started riding with groups and at events.  Eventually, those rides got longer, routes wider and the events more frequently attended.  Now, at 55 years of age, I find no evidence of slowing down.  Where to from here?  No plans, other than to keep riding, and encouraging others as well.",Surpassing 9K miles this year,1

They sent me home with all these brochures and info and I’m sitting here confused about how it works. Not the testing, but the interaction between myself, the company on the brochure and my doctor.

I picked out one brochure that allows blood testing for everything I want to screen for, that you can do at 9 weeks. Okay. Now what? I don’t work in the medical field and I’m not sure how this is supposed to work, do I contact the number on the brochure and let them know I want to do it or do I wait until my appointment on the 17th and tell my doctor what I want?

Context: Kvothe, Bast and Chronicler are talking about what makes a story. Here is an abbreviated extract:

""

Kvothe nodded. “Exactly. He finds the mad hermit in the woods, proves himself worthy and learns the names of all things, just like Taborlin the great. Then with these powerful magics at his beck and call, what does he do?”

Chronicler shrugged. “Finds the villains and kills them.”

“Of course.” Kvothe said grandly. Clean, quick and as easy as lying. We know how it ends practically before it starts. That’s why stories appeal to us, they give us the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack.” Kvothe leaned forward. “If this were some tavern tale, all half truth and senseless adventure I would tell you how my time at the university was spent with a purity of dedication. I would learn the ever changing name of the wind, rode out and gain my revenge against the Chandrian.”

...

“But while this would make for an entertaining story it would not be be truth. The truth is this. I had mourned my parents’ death for three years and he pain of it had faded to a dull ache.”

We were taking it very slow because she had gotten out of an abusive relationship and to be honest, I was very happy with that. We made out a lot but she wanted to wait for sex which honestly make me love her all that much more. I told her I loved her all the time but she said she wasn't ready to reciprocate which I was totally cool with...and honestly made me even more attracted to her because she was willing to be vulnerable. 

On Sunday the 9th the basically broke up with me via text. I was like what in the hell and begged her to let me come over or at least call her on the phone. She said she was really sort but she wasn't ready for a commitment and I could tell that she had blocked my number. She also deleted me off of facebook and either blocked me or deleted her Instagram. 

We work at the same restaurant where we are both servers, or at least we did because she didn't show up all week. I asked our boss if she had quit, she said she didn't receive anything formal and wasn't ready to fire her yet since my GF had all her shifts covered. I was expecting to be able to talk it out and reason with her at work but since she was a no-show I decided to go to her apartment because she honestly since I was in love with her, she owed me more than a text. Well I stopped by and her roomates said she'd moved out and wouldn't tell me where she'd gone. 

So I spent the entire last week in a fog because my entire reason for living had been ripped away from me. I was having a really hard time last night and one of the cooks told me that she moved in with her ex who is in the military and they are planning on moving away. I was DEVASTED. Her ex is like some top gun pilot or something but he's also a drunk who I know abused her in many ways. I know I'm just a server and not fucking Tom Cruise but I have so much more to offer her than some pretty boy bullshit. 


I want her back so bad I can hardly stand it. I haven't slept or really eaten in a week. But I also want to confront her on her lie. How do I both confront her on lying to me and win her back?

I am pretty sure I know where his house is and I want to try and stop over there and confront her. Should I do this?


tl;dr: ex broke up with me because she's afraid of commitment but she's moving in with her ex and moving away with him since he's in the military. I'm devasted and want to confront her on the lie and win her back. How do I do this?

505,lilhellatired,0,1545074668.0,0,t3_a72ydr,creepyencounters,"Hi! I was recommended to this subreddit, as my post might fit under it.

If, like me, you rely on public transportation, you've probably seen some shit. I've seen my fair share of altercations, I've had people be snippy with me for accidentally bumping into them.

I work a typical 9-5, so the subways are pretty crowded to and from work. This incident in particular, I had worked a few hours overtime. When I got in the subway, there wasn't much of a crowd. I sat down in the middle of an empty row of seats and pulled out my phone to pass the time.

Though there were people sprinkled throughout the subway car, the seats to the left and right of me remained empty during the beginning of my commute. On one stop someone sat down on the right seat next to me. Although there were plenty of empty seats around the train, it didn't bother me because it's public transportation after all and anyone can sit wherever.

I don't remember exactly what I was doing on my phone. I was probably either looking at Facebook or Instagram. All I really remember was that out of the corner of my eye, the man next to me turned to face me.

Whenever I'm met with someone trying to interact with me in public, 90% of the time I ignore them. Unless it's to ask a quick question, or other benign things, I don't engage. As a woman around 5 feet, I can't help but feel wary about my surroundings and I don't want to invite unwanted advances or confrontations when I'm out and about.

So in this situation, I just looked down at my phone. The problem was that this person kept staring at the right side of my head.

I didn't dare to glance directly at him, but I tried to look at him from my peripheral vision. When I tell you that my entire body went cold, I'm telling you I got those nasty prickles on my skin when I figured out that he was grinning at me. Don't really know how to describe it other than the fact that he was smiling ""ear-to-ear.""

Once I realized that this man was smiling at me I couldn't focus on anything else. His face seemed to get bigger and bigger, looming to the right of me. I don't know if this was a trick of my mind or he was leaning closer. It got to the point where I was so focused on my peripheral vision, his face looked like it was floating. My face heated up considerably while the rest of my body felt like it had goose bumps. As the minutes ticked by, this felt like the longest period of my life. In retrospect maybe I should've said something? But I was petrified. I honestly don't know how this man had enough energy to smile for that long. My face hurts after smiling for 5 minutes.

I decided early on that I would get off a stop earlier in case this man decided to follow me. I didn't feel like my life was threatened because I was still in public, but I wanted to be on the safe side.

When the stop came up, I waited until the last second. Then I stood up and practically ran out of the subway car. He didn't follow. I made the rest of my way home safely but I couldn't shake that unnerving feeling. ",Underground Grin,1

After getting used to the Editor, which is still annoying in terms of controls, I decided to create something of worth and add it to the pool of mods. However this is no show off or preview since this mod is still in early development. I thought now would be the best time to ask for some of your ideas or wishes if you would be interested.

Now to the important part: The faction mod I am developing is for one of the subfactions of the Ordinators, the Order of the Watch. Without spoiling too much of the story, you will be given a special chance to join them what usually is not possible for grown up dunmer. But even with that you will first have to go through some trials to get there. The idea is to keep this faction as basic as it can be. That means that I am trying to keep as close to the main game as I can, with not adding many new places or changing the style of the Ordinators. It should feel like you would still be playing the main game but this time you can, if you want, join the cool looking faith guards. The biggest difference you will probably notice would be a new storyline for a faction with long written dialogues and background informations that tries to stay close to the lore.  There will be new and old NPCs to interact with while doing the quests. You will have to work hard for every part of your indoril armor in an optional questline. But as I said after all, if you do not want to join the Order of the Watch you will notice almost no difference to the base game.  


Now, what do I need from you guys? 

1. If my mod interests you, tell me. That keeps me motivated.
2. How many quests would you like to see in a faction? Main- and Subquests.
3. Do you prefer quests more task styled like the vanilla factions in the game, or do you prefer an ongoing story? Or both?
4. What makes the Ordinators special to you?
5. What should be different as Ordinator in the game world?
6. What would you like to see in general?
7. Anything else?

Any of these questions answered would help me out. If you have any questions just go ahead and ask me. I would be thankful to get some help for my project by you guys. Thanks in advance for giving me your time.",I need your ideas to make my faction mod awesome,1

I'm looking for a caring domme/mommy.  I'm not looking for some hardcore domme who says if you want to talk to me then go strip down and run around outside naked and film it all while you do.
I don't migh tasks, they can be fun, but complicated and elaborate I just can't do.  

I want  to find someone who is a mix between a friend and a domme.  A person where we both can connect and share about whatever, develop a friendship, and also have some dirty fun.
I love verbal humilation and being degraded and made fun of. I like some risky tasks around the house. Both of us sharing some pics here and there.  Talking about and exploring all our messed up fantasies.  
But also have some times when we are just talking and saying what's going on in our lives.

I'm not sure if I've explained this all very well, so feel free to contact me and ask questions and we can develop this further.
I hope to hear from someone.",44 [M4F] Sub looking for Domme and friend,1

Sometimes taking it slow is best and sometimes it's not. Maybe we should get to know each other, and then we can take off from there. We can be flirty and cute while getting to know one another. I'm totally down to jump right in if that's what you need, but slow and flirty can be pretty fun. Let's see how we are feeling.

I'd really love to chat with some of DKP's more experienced ladies (29-55), but I'm also happy to chat with those a bit less so too (22-28). Married, single, moms, whatever your situation, I'm sure we can have some fun - some flirtation never hurt.

I would love some fun, casual conversation with some of DKP's lovely ladies. I love women of all shapes and sizes. I love to flirt, so let's have some flirty fun today. We can go as fast or slow as you would like.

Some information about me: I'm a 6ft, blond, very fit (runner) 31M. I am well educated and creative. I'm respectful, but can talk dirty with the best of them if you want me to.

My kinks: oral - especially giving oral, lingerie, natural bodies, trimmed bush, teasing, foreplay

Off limits: gore, non consensual, extreme bondage

I *did* visit the country during that time frame (Italy), but no traffic violation was committed. (We had a rental car at the time. We have no record of any traffic infraction at all. We weren't stopped by police nor did we receive any other type of notification while we were there that something had occurred.)

This office claims that the country has attempted to contact me on this infraction, has been unable to do so, and it has now gone to collections and there is now a large fee to be paid in addition to the original balance. 

They stated that if I did not dispute the claim within 30 days, they would assume it would be a valid claim and would proceed with collections. There is a payment form attached to the bottom; it smells like a hustle to try to get people to just pay them without questioning. 

This seems incredibly suspicious, so I did a bit of research: the first 2 hits were from people lodging complaints with BBB and CPFB, stating they're being harassed over false debts that were later dropped. 

I checked my credit report just now to see if this is appearing as a collections notice -- nothing yet. 

I called this office and told them we dispute this claim, that we have no evidence of any infraction, let alone a bill being requiring us to have to pay. 

The gentleman said they have a copy of the original report and could email it to me. I told him I wanted a printed copy in the mail. He said he'd send it and we'd go from there. 

Am I doing this right? Anything else I should consider? What should my next steps be?

Thanks in advance. ",Received a collections notice on a disputed international traffic violation - something smells fishy,1

1. Did you guys start your application online or in store?
2.

- the population is too large for the planet to support over 7 billion people due to resource limitations, especially water;

- society relies on wealth disparity (to a certain extent) to run;

- we don’t have an international committee effectively governing large corporations that exploit labor in poorer countries (India, China, etc) which perpetuates the issue. 

I was having this discussion with my partner last night and we couldn’t agree on a point, so I’m curious to understand views from the other side.

So, that was the past and now I continue to look for a scorchbeast free home somewhere close to the source of that delicious cranberry jam that I can't get enough of. But as of right now I'm have to admit I do not know enough about them (SBs) mechabically speaking to make an informed decision.

Does anyone have any hard data on how far scorchbeasts will stray from their known spawn points? Is there a map that shows this flying range included with their spawn locations? (I have seen the spawn map)

I actually enjoy killing scorchbeasts, but I don't wanna do it everytime I go back to camp. Sometimes a guy just want some piece and quiet time to make some hard inventory decisions and have an inner monologue about the ethics of hoarding.

695,Pretentious_Fella,0,1545074766.0,0,t3_a72yyo,apple,"I remember back in 2014 when I bought the iPhone 6. Came in from an iPhone 5 and it was a HUGE jump! My 5 became relatively slower with the new iOS 8, whereas the 6 was the latest and greatest at the time. 

Fast forward to 2017, my iPhone 6 became slow (comparatively) with iOS 10 and there was an apparent decrease in the overall speed of the phone even when I wasn’t comparing it side by side with any other device. Then I upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus.

Fast forward to late-2018, I just switched to iPhone XS Max a couple of weeks ago and today I picked my 7 Plus again to start using it as a “secondary” phone. Now the thing is, it doesn’t feel slow. Even though it’s been 2 years since it’s release, it doesn’t feel slow/lagging behind the competition at all! It still feels a very usable phone in 2018, in fact it’s right up there with some SD845 phones out there which is extremely impressive if you think of it. 

This got me to thinking, most of us (myself included) are so eager to jump to these pointless “speed tests” and we conclude that this year’s iPhone isn’t all that much fast after all, but the real prowess of the A-series chips can only be seen in the long run. They hold up extremely well compared to the iPhone 6-era.

However he is slow 65 off pace and Is not super strong. He has something like 66 off physical.

I play in a 4231(2) with him as the sole striker. I thing the instruction run behind of the defence makes no sense for him because of his pace and strength. Y have tryed with the standard instruction and he is good. He made 101 goals in 149 matches. But I think I am not getting all the juce. I want him to step a little behind the defence so he can shoot properly. I create a lot of good chanses with my 5 middlefields.

###How do I become verified?  

1. Take a pic of you showcasing that phat booty. Pics must be of you standing and showing your ass from the back but can be at a slight angle. No bending over/forward, closeup shots, lying down, frogbutts, topdown shots, leg raised up, pants coming up to your ass cheek shots or any other angle or camera trick to try and deceive us. We must be able to see all of that ass. Examples: [pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/xTYU48x.jpg), [pic 2.](https://i.redd.it/gthu98x7qx021.jpg)  **Absolutely no photoshop**!

2. You must also be holding a piece of paper with your **handwritten** reddit username, name of this sub and today's date (date when you are verifying). The paper must be crumpled then smoothed back out.  

3. Send the pic to us in a **modmail**. Do not post it in the sub.

4. Please be sure you do indeed have a phat ass before sending us any pics. After all that is what this sub is for. There are many other subs out there dedicated to asses but this one is for phat asses. Remember, big ≠ phat, there needs to be some shape to it. Read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pawg/comments/9li3w3/psa_rules_will_now_be_more_heavily_enforced_here/) before starting the verification process.

###What comes with being verified?  

1. You get a ""Verified PAWG"" user flair. Any post you make here will have that flair on your username. You also become an approved submitter. 

2. You will be allowed to promote your personal subreddit, tumblr, pornhub etc **EXCEPT** for any platform that allows sales. Such platforms include but not limited to: patreon, manyvids, clip stores, etc and will result in an immediate ban from our sub. Snapchat and kik are also prohibited.

3. You will be allowed an exception to our ""Perception/Ass assist"" flair. In other words, all those angles mentioned above will be available to you. Reason being, if you're verified, it means that you have a phat ass and no camera angle is going to change that. Let's be honest, it is one of the most annoying flairs since a lot of pics are taken from these kinds of angles, yet it's also one of our most necessary rules. All the more reason for being verified so the mods don't have to constantly go back through your post history to check.   

##So send us your pics today if you want to be one of our Verified PAWG's and do enjoy the season.",🎄 Tis the season for Verification 🎅,1

In 2017, the City Manager's office increased in size and budget by 240% by adding to bring back the Emergency Services program and add Economic Growth staff.

In 2018, the City Manager's office increased again by 1/3 to add Gang Prevention, Homeless Services, and Cannabis Policy/Enforcement staff.

It's perhaps too early to say for the 2018 increases, but did adding 14 full time employees for economic development in 2017 seem to have a positive effect?

Never had sex with a woman, never dated a woman, really never even hung out much with women.  I haven't had the best record with relationships -- I tended to have sex with hook-ups and my relationships with my friends (who were occasional hookups, too).  My most serious relationship was not very sexual -- my BF eventually left me because he wanted something more passionate.  My main sexual outlet in recent years has been masturbation -- often to porn -- gay, straight, bi, trans, lesbian, you name it.  My emotional life is really about my friends, who are almost exclusively gay men.  I've also been really active in the gay community more broadly.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few years, I've found myself more fascinated by the idea of sex with women.  (I would say that I am attracted to both sexes  - growing up I could find both guys and girls hot, but my crushes were always on other boys).  So, several months ago, I arranged to have sex with a female prostitute while visiting another city.  I loved it!  I've done this several times since, but I know that it's not a sustainable model -- I don't have that kind of money.  But I'm now in the awkward position of realizing that I prefer men emotionally (I have almost no female friends) but women sexually.  Nobody else knows about this.

I don't know what I should do now.  I think if I ""came out"" about my interest in women I might lose a lot of my friends.  My ideal world might be: have sex with women (with no commitment beyond FWB) but love my male friends.  But I doubt many women would be up for that.  My bi and straight male friends have often complained about the difficulty of having sex with women without emotional commitment.  I really don't know what I could offer to a woman romantically.  And my few female friends are mostly married.  I know that most women won't date bi men, let alone one who has lived his life as gay.  (Most of the bi guys I've known have either remained closeted or decided to live their lives as gay men, and just beat off to straight porn or something).  I'm decent looking, but pushing into middle age, and I doubt that I could pick up women just for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?",A very queer quandary -- I had sex with a woman -- and I liked it.,1

Normally, I would use the 16x PCI slot for my raid card to handle all of these drives.

933,winnabenna,0,1545074727.0,0,t3_a72yq5,mentalillness,"I (24 F) recently started seeing a therapist again in September after years of going without one. I am no stranger to counseling as I started when I was about 4 or 5. The last time I saw a therapist was probably 2012 or 2013 and I just went back to my childhood psychiatrist. 

This year I found one doctor and went to a few appointments before realizing she was NOT for me. So I just cancelled my next appointment and never went back. Easy. Then I started doing online therapy (video chat). I really thought I enjoyed this person but the past few appointments have been very disappointing. She can’t stay on topic, has taken a very long time to fax a referral for a psychiatrist, is almost always late, seems to be somewhat judgmental (or at-least makes me feel like it). I’ve been trucking through but tonight I have an appointment and I am dreading it. The last three or four sessions we discussed literally nothing. I even got frustrated and very annoyed last time because more than half of the appointment she spent looking for my referral letter on her computer. I’m obviously shy to speak up and afraid of confrontation (hello anxiety) which is why I am turning here. I don’t know how to say this isn’t working out and obviously in person I would probably just ghost...but I feel like that’s not an easy option since we text and have a standing appointment time. 

So, any advice?

TLDR: I don’t think my online therapist is the right fit anymore and I am unsure on how to “break up” with them. ",Advice on ”breaking up” with your therapist?,1
